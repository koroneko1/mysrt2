1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,350
Hey! Are you done yet?

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,150
Where do you keep the alcohol and cotton pads? I can't find them.

3
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,150
I told you to wash your face but you're washing your hair instead...

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,330
If it keeps getting wet, your wound will not heal.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,820
I didn't think it would be hard to wash my hair with one arm.

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,580
Although it's not easy either.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,480
Getting a head massage like this feels so nice.

8
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,680
If I ever have a partner...

9
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,860
and they do this for me...

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,280
I'd love them to death.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,770
Shut up.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,020
Come here, I'll wash the shampoo off.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,580
Okay.

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
You're so...

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,640
Why am I doing this for you?

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,180
What are you smiling about?

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,800
Can you wash my face for me too?

18
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,570
You're so annoying!

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,080
Hey! It'll get in my eyes!

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,580
Don't you feel bad for me?

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,040
That's enough, can you give me some water?

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
Sure.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
Here you go.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,350
You're doing it like this?!

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,280
Is this enough yet?

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,880
Hey!

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,080
My arm hurts!

28
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,350
Why don't you go back home so you'll have people to help you out?

29
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,370
Why would you come here and sleep alone?

30
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,280
If my family knows what happened yesterday, I'll never hear the end of it.

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,420
Anyway, if you don't want me to sleep alone...

32
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,910
Why don't you come sleep with me?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No way.

34
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,620
Stay still, okay?

35
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,510
I'm asking you seriously...

36
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,280
Don't you have any close friends?

37
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,570
I always see you hanging out alone.

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,080
If it's in the past, I have a few.

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,950
But because my family had to move around often...

40
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,110
I don't have any close friends now.

41
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,200
But this time we're back here for good.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,710
I'm thinking of finding someone I can befriend...

43
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,350
Someone around here...

44
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,310
Here.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,800
It's done.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,440
Your wound should dry up in around two days...

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,750
Then you won't have to cover it up anymore.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,740
Thank you.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,240
Anyways...

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,970
How's the bet going?

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,440
Don't forget the duration.

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,220
What should I make you do if you lose the bet?

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,550
Would you even be able to follow my request?

54
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,260
I'm sorry to say this but...

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Someone like me...

56
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,880
Is not a loner like you.

57
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,680
Just wait and we'll see which of us will get to order the other person to do what they want.

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,620
Okay.

59
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,220
I can understand why you changed the tutoring location to a park.

60
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,380
But why do I have to jog?

61
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,140
You might not know this, but doing something other than just reading a textbook is good.

62
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,950
It will help your brain memorize things better.

63
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,570
It will link the things we remember and the things we do together.

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,860
Get it?

65
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,310
Are you ready?

66
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,540
Yes.

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,530
Even when the earth is constantly revolving around the sun, we still feel as if it's staying still.

68
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,550
What is this theory called?

69
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,930
The Relativity Theory.

70
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,377
Take that!

71
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,740
Wrong.

72
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,080
It's 'Special Relativity'.

73
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,540
The special theory of relativity.

74
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,220
The theory is about constant speed, not acceleration speed.

75
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,020
Go run a small lap while reciting the information.

76
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,020
Go.

77
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,400
Yes Ma'am.

78
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,260
Special Relativity.

79
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,200
The theory about constant speed, not acceleration speed.

80
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,860
Spacial Relativity.

81
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,060
The theory about constant speed, not acceleration speed.

82
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,710
Special Relativity.

83
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,130
I can't believe I have to take lessons and also help my friend.

84
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,880
Man, Q.

85
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,710
It's clearly your problem.

86
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,910
Yet I still have to be concerned about it.

87
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,900
(I hope you'll enjoy the egg tarts.)

88
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,310
(Thank you so much, Q.)

89
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,860
Special Relativity.

90
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,260
The theory about constant speed, not acceleration speed.

91
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,130
Okay, cut!

92
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,680
Camera 1 and 2, you can manage the insert.

93
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,930
Quickly!

94
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,260
You can go ahead and take a rest.

95
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,440
Okay, thank you.

96
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,800
Great job, Mook.

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,510
Your acting was very good.

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,350
Let me deal with the inserts first.

99
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,750
In the mean time, you can prepare for the next shot.

100
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,400
Okay, thank you.

101
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,140
You're welcome.

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,970
Oh, you're still here?

103
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,220
Yes, um, I bought this for you.

104
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,220
Wow, where did you get this from?

105
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,020
Oh, you even know my favourite flavour.

106
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,680
It's very refreshing.

107
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,330
You don't have to wash the dishes.

108
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,840
I can handle this by myself.

109
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,570
It's just a couple of dishes.

110
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,680
When my mom bakes...

111
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,040
Q had to wash a lot more than this.

112
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,220
I think it's nice when you do that.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,600
Huh?

114
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,160
Just now, you used your name when referring to yourself.

115
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,440
I like it when you do that.

116
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,480
It's not like it's weird. My family talks like this all the time.

117
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,530
Well, we're done here for today.

118
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,480
I...

119
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,420
I'm going home.

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,150
And you...

121
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,260
You can call me X.

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,080
Come on.

123
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,020
Don't forget to rest a lot.

124
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,240
Rest? It's not even evening yet.

125
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,150
Up to you then. Do whatever you want.

126
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,200
And...

127
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,130
Where's my shirt?

128
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm going now.

129
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,910
Just leave it here.

130
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,040
You can wear my shirt back.

131
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,950
This one's my favorite.

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,820
Then, if you're okay...

133
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,040
see you on monday?

134
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,330
I'm off.

135
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,040
Bye.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,510
Q, can I come in?

137
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,080
Yes.

138
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,640
What are you up to?

139
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,129
Nothing. What's the matter?

140
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,800
Nothing!

141
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,710
It's just that since I've been busy, I haven't been able to talk to you a lot these days.

142
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,220
Oh.

143
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah.

144
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,040
Isn't this normal?

145
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,170
Or is something wrong with you?

146
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,150
Are you sick?

147
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,530
Um...

148
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,480
No, I'm fine.

149
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,020
But if you have something to tell me, you can go ahead.

150
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm listening.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,370
Oh... if it's about Rookie...

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,420
Then nothing's changed.

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,950
They confirmed with X.

154
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,040
Oh, okay.

155
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,460
And how is X? Is he okay now?

156
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,240
Do you have to visit him and treat his wounds again?

157
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,910
Hm?

158
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,750
No.

159
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,020
I have plans with Toy and Frank so the next time I see him should be on Monday.

160
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,880
Did you have any business with X?

161
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,240
No!

162
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,620
Um... I just wanted to tell you...

163
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,420
Before you decide on something, don't act too rashly.

164
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,170
Consider what you like or don't like. Think about it slowly.

165
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,400
You can always talk to me about anything.

166
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,350
I'm okay with everything that you like.

167
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,350
I'm fine with it.

168
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,530
What are you talking about?

169
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,620
I'm so confused.

170
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,330
Is there anything else?

171
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,930
I want to go take a shower.

172
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,530
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

173
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,680
I'll get going.

174
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,620
You can always talk to me!

175
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,200
I know!

176
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,000
(Day 5)

177
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,770
Have some water.

178
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,820
Thank you.

179
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,880
Thanks, man.

180
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,820
By the way, don't you have tutoring lessons today?

181
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,460
This is the location for my tutoring session today.

182
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,820
Mook doesn't have anywhere to be later, so Mind will pick her up from here.

183
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,400
Actually I did have somewhere to be.

184
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,040
But they canceled the appointment, so I'm free now.

185
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,020
Mook!

186
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm here to say thanks to someone who kept sending me things.

187
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,130
The snacks this morning was soooo yummy.

188
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,040
I really have to thank you, Q.

189
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,420
I finally get to meet you.

190
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,260
The egg tart and the snacks this morning...

191
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,640
And also the gifts on Saturday.

192
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,040
This morning?

193
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,600
Oh!

194
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,820
This morning, when you arrived just as the school gates opened.

195
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,040
Oh!

196
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,910
Yes.

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,550
I'm happy as long as you liked it.

198
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,640
Oh right. Your family bakes pastries, right?

199
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,680
Next time, bring some for me to try.

200
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,110
I'll review it for you.

201
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,710
You will?

202
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,460
Wow. If my mom knows, she'd be very happy.

203
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,710
My mom and my uncle are both fans of you.

204
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,600
By the way, how did you know that my family bakes...?

205
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,510
Um... you're the one who told me.

206
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,510
When we were messaging the other day.

207
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,660
Me?

208
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah!

209
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,710
Ah, the chat messages through Instagram!

210
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,040
Oh, right! I'm quite forgetful.

211
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,330
Okay.

212
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,680
You guys have to go practice, right?

213
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,930
Then... I'll...

214
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll cheer you on from over there.

215
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,240
Okay.

216
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Hang in there, everyone!

217
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,680
Bye bye.

218
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,110
- Hey.
- How are you?

219
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,040
What did you guys talk about?

220
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,200
Well...

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,000
(Day 6)

222
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,530
Are you here to get something to eat from my house again?

223
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,570
Nah, I'm just here to send you off.

224
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm worried you'll get into an accident again.

225
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,300
I'm sure you're planning to sleep at your condo anyway.

226
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,730
But if you're hungry, hurry up and follow me.

227
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,930
Mom won't say no to you.

228
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,800
Here.

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,680
I'll send you off here.

230
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,200
You should go inside.

231
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,600
Huh?

232
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,600
Won't you come in first?

233
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,060
You've already come this far.

234
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,970
No need to feel bad.

235
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,950
No thanks.

236
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
But don't worry.

237
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,570
I'll come by again for sure.

238
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,640
And also...

239
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,110
Also what?

240
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,680
Don't go all quiet on me. What is it?

241
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,040
You'll know when tomorrow comes.

242
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,000
See ya!

243
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,020
What is wrong with that guy?

244
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,240
(Day 9)

245
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,220
I want to eat noodles.

246
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,860
I can eat anything.

247
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,880
Nawa.

248
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,020
Can I talk to you for a moment?

249
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,570
What is it, Mr. Principal.

250
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,620
Then I'll get straight to the point.

251
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,020
I want you to film an introduction clip for Nawapol.

252
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,840
Since he got selected for the Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Program in Japan.

253
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,240
Can you do it?

254
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,950
Me?

255
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,110
Why me?

256
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,620
I've noticed that you and Nawapol are quite close lately.

257
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,970
And didn't Nawapol helped you when you had that car accident?

258
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,260
Yes.

259
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,840
Just think of it as helping to promote our school and our country.

260
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:11,460
Even if you didn't get selected, you're still an important part of the process of helping our country become well known by the whole world.

261
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,080
You should be proud that-

262
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,170
Okay, I'll do it.

263
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,220
You don't have to say anymore.

264
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,710
I feel as if I'm about to go to the Olympics or something.

265
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,840
That's the spirit! Then, I'll leave it up to you.

266
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,600
Okay.

267
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,110
It's your plan, isn't it?

268
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,350
Make yourself available next week.

269
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,680
You could just ask me to help you directly.

270
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,840
No need to get the Principle involved.

271
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,300
(Day 10)

272
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,440
(Day 11)

273
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,180
When are you going to ask Mook to go to the Awards Ceremony?
(Day 13)

274
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,620
There are less than ten days left 

275
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,910
That's right. I'm tired of messaging her for you.

276
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,640
I have lessons and tutoring classes.

277
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,400
You don't even seem to care about that bet with X.

278
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,660
You're even helping him film that video.

279
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Yeah, what's up with you?

280
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,180
Honestly...

281
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,680
I'm not that serious about winning or losing the bet.

282
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,200
You guys can stop if you want.

283
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,110
What? No!

284
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,420
You can't just quit.

285
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,620
You asshole.

286
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,200
You scared me.

287
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,220
Why?

288
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,840
Even if we quit, I'm the one who loses the bet.

289
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,550
Not you.

290
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,460
Um...

291
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,370
Uh...

292
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,780
Well, right now everything is going according to plan, right?

293
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,840
She returns your messages nicely, right?

294
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,770
Right?

295
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,440
Right.

296
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,700
See?

297
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,770
If you were to give up now, it's like...

298
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,300
like... you're a loser!

299
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,220
And you'll come complain to us.

300
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,950
About how you never win in anything.

301
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,340
Right?

302
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,750
I've lost so often.

303
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,910
I don't care if I lose one more time.

304
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,940
But I think what Toy said also has a point.

305
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,740
Don't you want to get a taste of winning for once?

306
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,880
Even if you fall down ten times but manage to get up on the eleventh time, it'll still make you proud, wouldn't it?

307
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,660
Oh shit.

308
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,510
Look at how cool you've become.

309
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,960
Fine.

310
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,220
If you guys don't want to quit, I'll have to keep asking you guys to help me.

311
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,570
The Principle wants me to help X film his video.

312
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,840
I'll be busy all weekend.

313
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,970
I'm so sick of it.

314
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,240
Hm?

315
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
It's not like I want to go.

316
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,860
Hm?

317
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,930
Really?

318
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,580
Q, did you know?

319
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,080
Lately, you've been spending even more time with X than with us.

320
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,750
But! It's okay.

321
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,310
You can leave Mook to me.

322
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,730
Up to you, then.

323
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,380
No worries, you can leave it up to me!
