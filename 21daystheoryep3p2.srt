00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,640
(Day 17)
I want to present our culture and tourist locations to people from other countries.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,130
I think that students from other countries will also try and show off their own cultures as well.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,440
If you need any help, just let me know and I'll gladly help you out.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,840
It seems very fun.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,370
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,550
I'm already disturbing you.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,080
It's my project and yet I asked for your help today.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,970
Last week we went with just the two of us.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,640
We didn't need Uncle's help at all.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,380
I don't get my mom at all.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,970
"How can two kids go alone?"

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,420
"You must bring an adult with you."

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,970
I'm really not overthinking things.

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,840
Anyway...

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,710
Don't forget to observe Q for me.

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,530
Oh. So the reason why you were so adamant on me going with them is so I can observe your son?

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,480
Why, you don't trust them when they're alone together?

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,600
Well, aren't they worrisome? Think about it.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,820
Normally, Q will work on something for just a short period of time.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,530
This time, he tells me every reason he can think of.

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,330
Last week when he came home, he was smiling all the time!

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,110
Isn't that suspicious?

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,950
You're his mom, not the owner of his life!

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,800
No matter what happens, all you should be doing is either be happy or sad for him.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,660
Why are you acting like his enemy?

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,730
But will he be okay with this kind of life?

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,020
Even your love life hasn't been working out at all.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,620
What about yours? Aren't you currently a single mom?

29
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,350
What if other people find out and start to tease him?

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,550
What if they won't accept him for who he is? What will I do?

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,710
So what if other people won't accept him?

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,280
It's not his responsibility to make everyone on earth happy.

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,040
If someone doesn't like it, then it's their problem.

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,620
- But-
- Hey.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,840
If your son is happy with his life, then you should be happy for him.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,980
But if other people is happy while your son suffers...

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,020
Would you be happy about that?

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,930
Don't stress out too much.

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,420
We're here.

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,950
Uncle Man, why didn't you stop by the restroom for me?

41
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,460
Look at that child.

42
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,750
Let's grab our stuff and go wait for him in the garden.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,660
Okay.

44
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,200
And I'll set your hair for you, I know how to do it.

45
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,550
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,370
Let's go.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,820
Let's grab our stuff.

48
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,310
The bone on your shoulder.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,880
Scapula.

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,510
Pelvis.

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,530
The bone connecting your spine to your legs.

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,930
What about... the cheekbones.

53
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,150
Zygomatic.

54
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,800
Cervical vertebrae.

55
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,020
The spine...

56
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,580
Behind your chest area.

57
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,060
Incorrect.

58
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,570
It's the neck area.

59
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
Here, come look at this.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,700
It's just one question that I got wrong.

61
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,420
What does it say.

62
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,800
The neck area.

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,200
Memorize it.

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,340
- Okay.
- Good.

65
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,170
Next time, I'll schedule us for the afternoon.

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,420
I have to go pick up Mook since she has work to do today.

67
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,620
Okay.

68
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,620
I'm fine with whenever so pick what time works best for you.

69
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm ready for your lessons every hour of the day.

70
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,200
Mhm, okay.

71
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,930
You're my number one student.

72
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,020
Oh, whose car is this.

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Can you help me move it?

74
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,330
Pass me that, I'll go keep it in the car first. Can you try pushing it?

75
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't know if it'll move.

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,950
Come on.

77
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,200
1, 2, 3!

78
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,180
What the hell, they blocked my car and still put the gear on Park.

79
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm in a hurry here.

80
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,480
Calm down, I'll go tell the employee to issue an announcement to find the owner of this car.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,260
Fine, I'll leave it to you then.

82
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,910
Okay.

83
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,310
Why won't she pick up?

84
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,730
(Someone parked in front of my car, I can't leave.
I won't make it in time, you should call a taxi.)

85
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:02,666
Wiman Saran Nawamin is a pavilion building with a spire hall in the middle of a pond by the Chao Phraya River. 

86
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:06,133
The roof lowers the spire in the Mondop Shape. 

87
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:10,155
Three-tiered decorations show the insignia of the grand building.

88
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,950
Wow, good job!

89
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,910
Thank you.

90
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,510
Where do we have to go next?

91
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,710
Oh, let's film some inserts and have some lunch first.

92
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,880
Okay.

93
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,240
Wait here, I'll get some water for you.

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,680
Okay, thank you so much.

95
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,260
Q!

96
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,370
Are you feeling tired? We can stop here for today.

97
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,350
We can film some time later.

98
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,530
If you're too tired, Uncle Man and I can manage the rest.

99
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,150
Oh. I'm not needed anymore am I?

100
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,640
You probably don't need my help anymore.

101
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,530
That's not what I mean. I just didn't-

102
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,860
Water's here!

103
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,080
- Here, have some.
- Okay.

104
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,420
Let me give you a massage.

105
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,130
Do you feel more relaxed?

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,710
Thank you.

107
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,680
Aren't you tired today?

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,110
The weather is so hot.

109
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,510
Oh, Q, what outfit should I-

110
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,900
Q!

111
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,480
Uncle Man, please hold on to this for me.

112
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,440
What's going on with them?

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,700
Maybe it's the heat.

114
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,660
Its been an hour since we made an announcement, not even one person showed up.

115
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,880
You can leave first.

116
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,110
I can wait with you.

117
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,060
I told you I'm available 24 hours a day.

118
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,800
Sorry. When I heard the announcement I was in the middle of lifting weights.

119
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,844
Wow!

120
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,400
If I had known that my car was obstructing such a pretty lady's car, I would've came running.

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,750
Since you're here, quickly move your damn car.

122
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,860
I've been waiting for a whole hour.

123
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,350
All of my schedules are fucked up now.

124
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,660
You should learn some manners next time.

125
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,710
Don't you know how to move your gear to Neutral?

126
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,220
Oh, a tomboy!

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,220
I already said sorry, what else do you want?

128
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,820
Fuck, and here I thought you were a woman. What a waste.

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,840
But that smart mouth of yours should be kissed by me once,

130
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,860
and I'm sure you can't get enough of it.

131
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,750
Asshole!

132
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,820
Stop harassing her!

133
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,280
Wait for me!

134
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,080
Q!

135
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,710
Q.

136
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,570
Why did you follow me? You don't want me here anyway.

137
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,510
Just go do whatever you want with whoever you want.

138
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,130
What's wrong with you? You were fine this morning.

139
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,820
Who told you that I didn't want you to come?

140
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,330
You're misunderstanding me. Tell me what's wrong, don't act like this.

141
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,330
This is how I am.

142
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,370
If you don't like it, then don't bother with me!

143
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,220
Fuck off!

144
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,220
Q, can you be more reasonable?

145
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
How about this.

146
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,510
If I did something to offend you, I'm sorry.

147
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,970
But you have to let me know what I did wrong.

148
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,750
That way, I won't repeat the same mistakes.

149
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,150
I just don't like it, okay?

150
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,570
I don't like it!

151
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,550
But...

152
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,150
I haven't done anything yet.

153
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,530
Shut up.

154
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,800
You like my uncle, don't you?

155
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,770
Why didn't you just come with him? Why'd you bring me too?

156
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,350
I like your uncle?

157
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,350
You're overthinking things.

158
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,480
Then what was that massage?

159
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,060
You liked it, didn't you?

160
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,660
Huh?

161
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
And what else? He fed you water.

162
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,480
Next, you'll be feeding each other food.

163
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,910
And eventually, you'll be feeding each other... something else!

164
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,330
Let go.

165
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,680
Stop it, Q!

166
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,620
You're seriously misunderstanding.

167
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,730
It's just a trifle matter.

168
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,080
Listen to me first.

169
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,330
No.

170
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,860
Why?

171
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
This whole thing...

172
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,480
is just a trifle matter to you, right?

173
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,660
Then what would it take for it to become an important matter?

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
Do you guys have to sleep together first?

175
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,970
Huh?

176
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,040
Let me tell you one thing.

177
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,950
If you want to become my aunt or uncle in law...

178
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Then keep on dreaming!

179
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,510
Are you... possessive of your uncle?

180
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,420
Or are you possessive of me?

181
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,020
Watch what you're saying.

182
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,910
Me? Possessive of you?

183
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,370
Q, listen to me.

184
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,060
I don't have romantic feelings for your uncle.

185
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,730
Because the one that I like...

186
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,710
is...

187
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,730
Why should I believe you?

188
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,680
I don't care if no one believes me.

189
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,600
But the one person that I hope will believe me...

190
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,600
Is you.

191
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,550
Will you trust me?

192
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,970
See ya.

193
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,160
Bye!

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,730
It's already so late, Mind is still not here?

195
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,420
Why don't you call her first to ask?

196
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,480
Woah. She called me so many times.

197
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,170
She also left a message...

198
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,330
"There's a car parked in front of mine so I can't leave."

199
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,500
"I won't make it in time."

200
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,750
"Call a taxi and go there first."

201
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,820
Mind can't pick you up?

202
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,020
Yeah. I have to get going.

203
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,570
You bought your motorcycle right?

204
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,130
Can you take me to call a taxi?

205
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,780
I can just give you a ride.

206
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,060
You guys made up, right?

207
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,820
So what's up?

208
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,950
What's wrong with you today?

209
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,060
You've been throwing tantrums like a child.

210
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,240
What tantrums?

211
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm still mad at you.

212
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,350
Let's finish filming first.

213
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,170
We need to have a talk tonight.

214
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,680
I'm the reason for your behavior?

215
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,970
Everything's resolved. Q...

216
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,550
understands now.

217
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,780
Now he's smiling.

218
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,460
Let me tell you one thing. I'm not into younger boys.

219
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,840
They like throwing tantrums and I'm too lazy to put up with that.

220
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,800
C'mon, get in the car so we can go to the next location.

221
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,680
Thank you.

222
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,080
I thought I wouldn't make it in time.

223
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,150
I haven't been on a motorcycle for a while, I enjoyed the ride.

224
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,820
Um... then... I'll wait for you here.

225
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,300
You can go upstairs and do your work.

226
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,350
I don't really have any work scheduled.

227
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,440
I'm just here for a casual meeting.

228
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,240
Bank, the director, wanted to meet me.

229
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
Maybe I'll get lucky and get casted in a drama.

230
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,220
You don't have to wait for me, I don't want to waste your time.

231
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,730
Mind will pick me up later.

232
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,170
Then I'll wait until Mind comes.

233
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,640
I'll wait with you in case she comes late, so you won't be lonely.

234
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,770
No need.

235
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,680
If you want to wait.

236
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,280
Just wait inside.

237
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,350
Come on.

238
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,750
Okay.

239
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,480
All done.

240
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,970
What were you thinking, charging in like that?

241
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,220
It's a good thing you weren't seriously injured.

242
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,080
If the guard didn't come in time, you'd end up in the temple.

243
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,460
Sorry.

244
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,260
My body moved on its own.

245
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,150
Anyways, thank you.

246
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,200
What you did was very brave.

247
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,880
Ever since I was young...

248
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,220
When I run into a problem, everyone thinks I can deal with it on my own.

249
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,020
No one has stepped in to help me before.

250
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,910
You're the first one.

251
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,620
I...

252
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,440
I know.

253
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,880
That guy deserved it.

254
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,510
But you have to be careful. He's a huge guy.

255
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,970
Thank god you didn't die from his kicks.

256
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,060
I didn't die from his kicks, but I might die by your hands.

257
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,000
Sorry.

258
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,730
I have to call Mook.

259
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,460
I don't think I can pick her up in time.

260
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll be right back.

261
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,579
Why are you making that face? Did things not go smootly?

262
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,380
Who told you that? Everything went well.

263
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,110
Look, they even offered me a contract.

264
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,180
Huh? Then why...?

265
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,259
Mind called.

266
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,240
She said she ran into some problems.

267
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,770
So she can't pick me up anymore.

268
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,080
Oh...

269
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,730
What a bummer.

270
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,260
So... you got ditched by Mind...

271
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,150
But I'm still here! Do you need to go anywhere else? I can give you a ride.

272
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,840
Nope.

273
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,930
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,150
Because of this... you've been stuck with me the whole day.

275
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,280
It's nothing.

276
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,130
Next time, if Mind is not available, just call me!

277
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,280
I'm super fast and also drive safely!

278
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,060
You're talking as if you're trying to get a girl.

279
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,750
That was my stomache. I haven't eaten anything yet today.

280
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,710
Really?

281
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,130
I'm also hungry.

282
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,950
How about this.

283
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,240
You can choose whichever restaurant you want.

284
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,380
Since you've been here with me the whole day, I'll treat you to a meal.

285
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,910
Hm... are you sure?

286
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,570
You might go broke from treating me.

287
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,330
Wow.

288
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,980
I'm gonna go broke at this rate.

289
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,970
How will I have enough money to pay?

290
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,170
Don't look down on this place. The food here is amazing.

291
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
I've been eating here since I was just a kid.

292
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Okay, I'll finish everything.

293
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,420
If Mind was here,

294
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,750
I wouldn't get to eat this.

295
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,660
How come?

296
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,510
When you're with a medical student...

297
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,730
"Wait, this has a very high percentage of fat!"

298
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,080
"Wait, this has very high cholesterol."

299
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,400
"This is even worse, so much sodium."

300
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,570
"You'll get bloated."

301
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
"This one will make you fat."

302
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,110
She'll be like that and it gives me a headache.

303
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,970
No wonder why.

304
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,380
I always see you dance.

305
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,530
It's because you don't want to get fat, right?

306
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,040
That's not it.

307
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,040
Those dance practices...

308
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,440
It's for the opening stage of the Awards Ceremony.

309
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,310
Actually...

310
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,000
the ceremony is in just a few days.

311
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,310
But...

312
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,950
I don't have a plus-one yet.

313
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,770
Then... do you...

314
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,860
Have anyone in mind yet?

315
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,110
I didn't really have anyone in mind.

316
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,330
But right now...

317
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,910
I think I do.

318
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,460
Actually...

319
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,710
I haven't even asked the person yet if they're free.

320
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,440
I'll give you a hint.

321
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,020
You know the person.

322
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,770
Not just casually,

323
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,200
But you know them very well.

324
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,950
I see.

325
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,310
X!

326
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,130
- Yes?
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

327
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,150
You can leave your outfit and props in the car.

328
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
I'll drive you back later.

329
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,950
Thank you so much.

330
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,940
Q!

331
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,170
Let's have a talk.

332
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
Then I'll wait for you guys inside.

333
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,820
Sure.

334
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,180
Uncle Man...

335
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,130
Did you know that your behavior today was very inappropriate?

336
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,510
How did you even come to that conclusion about X and I?

337
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,110
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,440
I don't know why I was frustrated either.

339
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,500
I understand. It's happened to me before.

340
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,300
When you like someone, you'll feel as if you own them.

341
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,640
You'll feel possessive.

342
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,910
You're scared someone else will take them away from you.

343
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,930
I just don't know whether I just don't like it when my friends become friendly with someone else...

344
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,310
Or I...

345
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,680
Do you feel this way with Toy and Frank as well?

346
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,770
Hm?

347
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,480
You already have your answer.

348
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,730
Just ask your heart.

349
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,750
But...

350
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,260
If mom finds out...

351
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,710
If my friends find out...

352
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,970
Isn't it just one of the many problems you have to face in life?

353
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,820
If you know what you have to face...

354
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,750
All you need to do is be prepared.

355
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,100
Love is always worth the risk.

356
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,330
But...

357
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,060
I'm just not sure.

358
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,260
Because when I'm with X...

359
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,550
I feel as if...

360
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,480
I know.

361
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,380
When love occurs...

362
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,730
it does not care about gender.

363
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,460
If it happens...

364
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,310
You just need to accept it.

365
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,740
Or... just let it go.

366
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,800
Then...

367
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,060
What do you think I should do?

368
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,350
That's up to you.

369
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,780
But don't let other people's feelings dictate your own.

370
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,200
Got it?

371
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,040
Don't worry.
