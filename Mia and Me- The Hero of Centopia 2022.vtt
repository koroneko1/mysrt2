15:46.285 --> 15:48.681
Oh, most of the time.

15:48.716 --> 15:49.715
Well, that's not right.

15:53.358 --> 15:54.588
Ah!

15:54.623 --> 15:56.326
All hands on deck!

15:56.361 --> 15:57.360
Little help, please.

16:00.464 --> 16:01.331
Oh dear.

16:01.366 --> 16:02.299
And batten your hatches.

16:02.334 --> 16:04.367
We're in for a bumpy ride!

16:04.402 --> 16:05.302
Whoa!

16:05.337 --> 16:07.535
[chanting]

16:09.209 --> 16:13.739
May I present my newest
invention, the Phuddlen, yeah.

16:13.774 --> 16:17.776
Centopia's first flying DJ deck.

16:17.811 --> 16:18.810
That's right, folks.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.318
It's all just part of the show.

16:21.353 --> 16:26.158
[laughs] [gasps]

16:26.193 --> 16:28.325
Oh look, more
guests arriving, dear.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.392
They're not guests.

16:29.427 --> 16:31.064
They're party crashers.

16:31.099 --> 16:34.331
Everybody, run!

16:34.366 --> 16:36.729
[screaming]

16:40.735 --> 16:43.340
[coughing]

16:47.709 --> 16:49.247
They're OK?

16:49.282 --> 16:50.248
ELF: Hey, welcome.

16:50.283 --> 16:51.084
[chatter]

16:51.119 --> 16:51.711
ELF: Welcome back!

16:51.746 --> 16:53.581
Hey, there.

16:53.616 --> 16:56.254
Oh, let me do the talking.

16:56.289 --> 16:57.387
Are you sure?

16:57.422 --> 17:00.291
Elves of main
island, I am Iko.

17:00.326 --> 17:03.261
[gasping]

17:03.296 --> 17:05.395
Are you OK, Iko?

17:05.430 --> 17:06.825
Who said that?

17:06.860 --> 17:08.398
Where am I?

17:08.433 --> 17:09.531
Hey, Mo!

17:09.566 --> 17:10.631
Yuko!

17:10.666 --> 17:12.600
Hey, Mia.

17:12.635 --> 17:13.865
Onchao.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.207
Who's your friend?

17:15.242 --> 17:16.340
Is he from your world?

17:16.375 --> 17:17.737
Pretty boy.

17:17.772 --> 17:20.146
No, I-- I just
bumped into him.

17:20.181 --> 17:22.280
You call that a bump, Mia?

17:22.315 --> 17:23.710
Whoa.

17:23.745 --> 17:25.877
Are you OK, friend?

17:25.912 --> 17:27.648
Are you my mommy?

17:27.683 --> 17:30.552
Mo, we need to
talk to your parents.

17:30.587 --> 17:31.718
Centopia's in trouble.

17:31.753 --> 17:33.390
IKO: Parents?

17:33.425 --> 17:35.689
I need to speak to
the king and queen.

17:35.724 --> 17:38.263
Most parents are
the king and queen.

17:38.298 --> 17:39.495
At your service.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.167
Welcome, party crashers.

17:41.202 --> 17:42.498
Oh, Mia.

17:42.533 --> 17:43.730
Good to have you back.

17:43.765 --> 17:44.764
Thank you.

17:44.799 --> 17:46.832
Now, I recognize that uniform.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.834
You're from Lotus Island!

17:48.869 --> 17:50.638
Welcome to the party.

17:50.673 --> 17:52.904
You're going to take that with
you when you leave, aren't you?

17:52.939 --> 17:53.905
Yes, Your Majesty.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.182
But I bring grave news.

17:56.217 --> 17:57.381
Toxor has escaped.

17:57.416 --> 17:58.613
[gasping]

17:58.648 --> 17:59.515
Who's Toxor?

17:59.550 --> 18:00.450
To the palace.

18:00.485 --> 18:01.682
We have much to discuss.

18:01.717 --> 18:03.354
Carry on with the
party, everyone.

18:03.389 --> 18:04.619
We'll be right back.

18:04.654 --> 18:07.589
[music playing]

18:27.347 --> 18:31.811
[laughs]

18:31.846 --> 18:34.385
Ah.

18:34.420 --> 18:35.419
[laughs]

18:47.664 --> 18:48.762
He he.

18:48.797 --> 18:50.830
No more flying for
you, I'm afraid.

18:56.376 --> 18:57.771
[neighs]

18:58.477 --> 18:59.707
[giggles]

18:59.742 --> 19:00.345
Huh?

19:10.016 --> 19:10.982
[neighs]

19:11.017 --> 19:11.620
[gasps]

19:17.958 --> 19:20.893
Master Toxor, we've
caught a unicorn.

19:20.928 --> 19:22.961
Very pretty.

19:22.996 --> 19:23.962
[laughs]

19:23.997 --> 19:24.930
Pretty?

19:24.965 --> 19:26.404
I'll give you pretty.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.513
[laughs]

19:36.548 --> 19:38.878
[neighs]

19:39.881 --> 19:40.847
Better.

19:40.882 --> 19:43.916
I shall call you Hook Face.

19:43.951 --> 19:44.884
[neighs]

19:44.919 --> 19:46.952
You, big fella, mount me.

19:46.987 --> 19:50.021
Yes, master.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.595
Back to my lair, Hook Face.

19:52.630 --> 19:54.696
Ride like the wind.

19:54.731 --> 19:55.994
[laughs]

19:56.029 --> 19:58.535
[music playing]

20:01.738 --> 20:02.935
MIA: That's Toxor?

20:02.970 --> 20:05.575
MO: I know, so gross.

20:05.610 --> 20:06.972
And stronger than ever.

20:07.007 --> 20:09.975
He used his dark magic
to change my dad's guards

20:10.010 --> 20:12.384
into mindless slaves.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.286
Oh my.

20:13.321 --> 20:14.452
[gasps]

20:14.487 --> 20:16.718
My dad died
trying to stop him.

20:16.753 --> 20:18.423
I'm sorry.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.920
Empress Shuba sent me
here to gather an army.

20:20.955 --> 20:23.461
If we don't stop Toxor
on Lotus island--

20:23.496 --> 20:26.827
Then all of the
islands will fall.

20:26.862 --> 20:29.027
Who's that kicking
Toxor's butt?

20:29.062 --> 20:31.403
MAYLA: The hero of Centopia.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.635
Maybe she can help us?

20:32.670 --> 20:34.604
MAYLA: She left
this world long ago.

20:34.639 --> 20:37.970
But you coming here, Mia, at
the same time that Toxor has

20:38.005 --> 20:41.380
escaped cannot be a coincidence.

20:41.415 --> 20:42.942
Tell us the oracle, Mia.

20:42.977 --> 20:44.581
The oracle?

20:44.616 --> 20:48.354
A monstrous evil will
forever ravage all the lands

20:48.389 --> 20:51.423
lest the faraway
child and a new friend

20:51.458 --> 20:53.392
gather the precious
three in hand.

20:53.427 --> 20:55.823
Whoa, my orders were
to gather an army,

20:55.858 --> 20:58.760
not gather precious
things and hold hands.

20:58.795 --> 21:00.564
What's this oracle anyway?

21:00.599 --> 21:03.864
An oracle is what brings
me from my world to Centopia.

21:03.899 --> 21:05.338
Your world?

21:05.373 --> 21:07.098
What island is that?

21:07.133 --> 21:08.902
It's not an island.

21:08.937 --> 21:10.838
It's a land far far--

21:10.873 --> 21:12.345
[gasp] Mia!

21:12.380 --> 21:14.644
Yes, I'm the faraway child.

21:14.679 --> 21:16.679
I'm the one who can stop Toxor.

21:16.714 --> 21:19.077
[music playing]

21:47.877 --> 21:51.010
Ah, who needs
wings to fly around

21:51.045 --> 21:54.816
like some sort of annoying
insect when I've got you,

21:54.851 --> 21:56.455
Hook Face.

21:56.490 --> 21:58.985
My valiant trusted steed.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.955
Now, why don't you go and eat
some mushrooms or something?

22:01.990 --> 22:04.463
[shouting]

22:04.498 --> 22:07.059
What?

22:07.094 --> 22:09.501
[laughing and groaning]

22:17.709 --> 22:19.071
What are you numbskulls doing?

22:19.106 --> 22:21.546
You're supposed to be
looking for my red stone.

22:21.581 --> 22:23.713
Have you found it?

22:23.748 --> 22:25.979
Here, master.

22:26.014 --> 22:26.617
Excellent.

22:29.589 --> 22:33.789
You're lucky I don't throw
you all into the pool of fear.

22:33.824 --> 22:34.559
That's madness.

22:34.594 --> 22:35.120
No please.

22:35.155 --> 22:36.627
Very bad place.

22:36.662 --> 22:38.926
Get out of my sight
before I change my mind.

22:38.961 --> 22:39.828
Never again.

22:39.863 --> 22:41.599
Master, master.

22:41.634 --> 22:45.196
I've come to report we have
converted more elvish villages.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.539
Your army grows.

22:47.574 --> 22:48.034
Yes, yes.

22:48.069 --> 22:48.969
Well done.

22:49.004 --> 22:50.674
Glitch, isn't it?

22:50.709 --> 22:51.741
Yes, master.

22:51.776 --> 22:55.646
Hmm, I need you to help me.

22:55.681 --> 22:56.944
Anything, master.

22:56.979 --> 22:59.012
I need you to attack me.

22:59.047 --> 23:00.618
Uh, why?

23:00.653 --> 23:03.654
Because I'm going to use
this red stone as a shield

23:03.689 --> 23:06.789
to defeat you just like
the hero of Centopia

23:06.824 --> 23:10.155
defeated me all those years ago.

23:10.190 --> 23:11.992
Now, how did she do it?

23:12.027 --> 23:14.060
She held it out like this.

23:14.095 --> 23:15.028
No, no.

23:15.063 --> 23:16.568
Like this.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.703
And-- all right, hit me, Glitch.

23:19.738 --> 23:20.132
OK.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.478
You call that an attack?

23:25.513 --> 23:28.041
Put your back into it.

23:28.076 --> 23:30.043
Ow!

23:30.078 --> 23:32.848
Ugh.

23:32.883 --> 23:34.179
Are you OK, master?

23:34.214 --> 23:34.883
Fine.

23:34.918 --> 23:35.587
I'm fine.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.017
I'm fine.

23:37.052 --> 23:38.524
Stupid stone.

23:38.559 --> 23:40.790
Why does it not obey me?

23:40.825 --> 23:42.220
I don't know, master.

23:42.255 --> 23:45.498
Ooh, maybe you use
your dark magic on it?

23:45.533 --> 23:48.259
Mm, I think I'll use my
dark magic on it, Glitch.

23:48.294 --> 23:54.232
[laughs] Oh yes.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.233
Oh yes.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.003
Look!

23:56.038 --> 23:56.773
Glitch, look!

23:56.808 --> 23:57.840
It glows!

23:57.875 --> 23:58.775
It glows.

23:58.810 --> 24:01.745
[laughs] Huh?

24:01.780 --> 24:03.175
What is this?

24:03.210 --> 24:05.045
Ooh.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.619
Sire, we need your army now.

24:07.654 --> 24:10.556
Iko, we can't do anything
until we figure out

24:10.591 --> 24:11.755
the rest of the oracle.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.559
This was made on Lotus Island.

24:13.594 --> 24:14.593
Huh?

24:14.628 --> 24:16.892
No, my parents gave it to me.

24:16.927 --> 24:18.663
Why is it glowing?

24:18.698 --> 24:19.895
It's too early to go back.

24:19.930 --> 24:22.601
I just got here.

24:22.636 --> 24:24.669
Oh look, there's a
frog in the window.

24:24.704 --> 24:25.835
It's Toxor!

24:25.870 --> 24:28.134
What are you up
to you pesky elves?

24:28.169 --> 24:30.609
What is this sorcery you weave?

24:30.644 --> 24:31.104
Elves?

24:31.139 --> 24:32.072
Can I see?

24:32.107 --> 24:33.172
Hi, elves.

24:33.207 --> 24:34.206
How did you get--

24:34.241 --> 24:35.273
Get out of the way, you idiot.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.684
You have a stone too.

24:39.719 --> 24:41.246
IKO: He's got the ruby shield!

24:41.281 --> 24:43.017
We're coming for you, Toxor.

24:43.052 --> 24:45.250
Come and get it,
you winged worms.

24:47.991 --> 24:49.089
[burps]

24:49.124 --> 24:51.960
If that's Toxor,
then who is that?

24:55.735 --> 24:57.603
[neighs]

24:57.638 --> 24:59.000
It's another gemstone.

24:59.035 --> 25:00.001
Three gemstones?

25:00.036 --> 25:01.299
Three precious things.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.333
[neighs]

25:02.368 --> 25:04.038
We need them to defeat Toxor.

25:04.073 --> 25:07.041
Three gemstones to defeat me?

25:07.076 --> 25:08.977
No, they're mine.

25:09.012 --> 25:11.243
Mine!

25:11.278 --> 25:11.881
No!

25:18.758 --> 25:21.121
[coughing]

25:26.029 --> 25:28.161
I breathed in burnt toad.

25:28.196 --> 25:30.229
Where did that
lightning come from?

25:30.264 --> 25:31.835
[neighs]

25:31.870 --> 25:34.233
Onchao thinks it may have
been the storm unicorn.

25:34.268 --> 25:36.708
Wait, you can
understand unicorns?

25:36.743 --> 25:37.236
Yes.

25:37.271 --> 25:39.040
[neighs]

25:39.075 --> 25:42.010
He says that the storm unicorn
loves to collect shiny things.

25:42.045 --> 25:43.814
It's got to be him.

25:43.849 --> 25:44.749
We have to find him.

25:44.784 --> 25:46.245
But my mission.

25:46.280 --> 25:49.820
Our mission is to
save Centopia together.

25:49.855 --> 25:51.250
Yes.

25:51.285 --> 25:54.385
If Mia is the faraway
child, then you, Lotus boy,

25:54.420 --> 25:56.321
must be the new friend.

25:56.356 --> 25:57.729
Ugh, friend?

25:57.764 --> 25:58.796
But I really need to--

25:58.831 --> 26:00.226
Trust the oracle, Iko.

26:00.261 --> 26:01.832
That's right.

26:01.867 --> 26:03.834
Mo and Yuko shall lead
our forces to Lotus Island

26:03.869 --> 26:06.067
and keep Toxor at
bay until you return.

26:06.102 --> 26:07.101
Ugh.

26:07.136 --> 26:09.169
Mia's quest sounds way more fun.

26:09.204 --> 26:12.073
Shucks, guess it's
just and me, Mo.

26:12.108 --> 26:14.878
[laughs] That's the spirit.

26:14.913 --> 26:16.044
Fine.

26:16.079 --> 26:17.650
Where do we find
this storm unicorn?

26:17.685 --> 26:19.751
He lives alone
on an island that

26:19.786 --> 26:21.852
floats above an endless ocean.

26:21.887 --> 26:22.754
Great.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.118
So how do we get there?

26:24.153 --> 26:27.660
My ship was destroyed.

26:27.695 --> 26:29.387
PHUDDLE: I got it,
I got it, I got it.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.730
I think I have an idea.

26:31.765 --> 26:33.996
PHUDDLE: [laughs]

26:34.031 --> 26:35.866
ELF: Don't go anywhere
just yet, folks.

26:35.901 --> 26:40.068
We're about to start
the ponycorn race.

26:40.103 --> 26:41.938
Are we going for
another lap, Phuddle?

26:41.973 --> 26:43.170
[laughs] No, no.

26:43.205 --> 26:46.877
Everything is 100%
under control!

26:46.912 --> 26:49.176
ELF: OK, if I can get all
the ponycorns to line up

26:49.211 --> 26:50.914
by the rainbow tent, folks.

26:50.949 --> 26:56.722
The king and queen will be here
shortly, so let's get ready.

26:56.757 --> 26:58.955
And remember, you've got
to be under three feet

26:58.990 --> 27:00.924
to compete in this race.

27:00.959 --> 27:03.157
[neighing]

27:04.831 --> 27:07.997
You just need to switch
this little guy off here and--

27:08.032 --> 27:08.932
Hi, Phuddle.

27:08.967 --> 27:09.768
Ah!

27:09.803 --> 27:11.132
Mia, you're back!

27:11.167 --> 27:12.870
It's good to see you too.

27:12.905 --> 27:15.202
My friends Iko and I need to
borrow your flying machine.

27:15.237 --> 27:15.972
PHUDDLE: Huh?

27:16.007 --> 27:17.039
Flying machine?

27:17.074 --> 27:18.942
Oh, the Phuddlen.

27:18.977 --> 27:20.075
Sure, Mia.

27:20.110 --> 27:22.110
Oh, are we going
to another party?

27:22.145 --> 27:23.276
We thank you, Phuddle.

27:23.311 --> 27:25.047
It takes a brave
man to volunteer

27:25.082 --> 27:26.411
for a mission this dangerous.

27:26.446 --> 27:28.215
Oh, you're welcome,
your majesty.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.085
I just-- what?

27:30.120 --> 27:31.922
Did I miss something?

27:31.957 --> 27:32.824
Thank you.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.958
Sorry, time to pack up.

27:34.993 --> 27:36.861
Party's over, everyone.

27:36.896 --> 27:39.831
[disappointed groans]

27:39.866 --> 27:42.735
We're off to save Centopia!

27:42.770 --> 27:45.100
[cheering]

27:46.433 --> 27:47.773
Long live Centopia!

27:52.813 --> 27:54.472
Yay, Centopia!

27:54.507 --> 27:56.045
Woo-hoo-hoo-ho.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.817
Seriously, what is going on?

27:58.852 --> 28:00.082
Mm.

28:00.117 --> 28:01.314
Mm.

28:01.349 --> 28:02.183
Huh?

28:02.218 --> 28:05.351
Oh god, get off me.

28:05.386 --> 28:06.792
My head hurts.

28:06.827 --> 28:09.157
That wretched storm unicorn.

28:09.192 --> 28:11.093
This gemstone is powerful.

28:11.128 --> 28:12.193
Yes.

28:12.228 --> 28:14.998
Yes!

28:15.033 --> 28:18.936
But no one can use
it against me now.

28:18.971 --> 28:21.202
Destiny calls, Glitch.

28:21.237 --> 28:24.810
Bring me the two remaining gems.

28:24.845 --> 28:27.945
Uh, where do I
start looking, master?

28:27.980 --> 28:28.374
Oh.

28:31.214 --> 28:33.346
You go to Stormy's
island because that's

28:33.381 --> 28:35.051
where the she-elf is going.

28:35.086 --> 28:37.020
You get both the
stones, you see?

28:37.055 --> 28:39.187
And don't fail me!

28:39.222 --> 28:40.386
Yes, master.

28:40.421 --> 28:42.828
I mean, no, master.

28:42.863 --> 28:44.291
Can I take Hook Face, master?

28:44.326 --> 28:48.031
Yes, and take two other
groundlings as well.

28:48.066 --> 28:48.427
Yeah.

28:48.462 --> 28:51.001
Woo!

28:51.036 --> 28:52.431
I said two.

28:52.466 --> 28:53.839
Huh?

28:53.874 --> 28:55.236
Oh.

28:55.271 --> 28:57.975
Oh, don't look so miserable.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.505
I'll let you rub my feet.

29:00.540 --> 29:02.507
[laughs] Yeah!

29:02.542 --> 29:04.542
[music playing]

29:10.990 --> 29:12.583
Make sure those ropes
are tight, Zolanda.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.288
On it.

29:14.323 --> 29:15.454
Gubu, we're going to need
more bananas than that if we

29:15.489 --> 29:16.829
want to get to Lotus Island.

29:16.864 --> 29:18.127
Yes, your majesty.

29:18.162 --> 29:19.832
Hey, you need a hand
with that anchor, Shiva?

29:19.867 --> 29:22.098
We can always go
with them, my dear?

29:22.133 --> 29:23.836
We're needed here, Raynor.

29:23.871 --> 29:26.168
We have to look after the
creatures of Main Island that

29:26.203 --> 29:27.840
can't defend themselves.

29:27.875 --> 29:30.205
Oh, we wanted to go on a boat.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.371
PHUDDLE: Ah!

29:31.406 --> 29:32.944
Phuddle, what
are you doing here?

29:32.979 --> 29:34.539
I thought you were getting
the Phuddlen ready?

29:34.574 --> 29:35.947
Yes, your majesty.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.377
Just had to grab
some vital supplies.

29:37.412 --> 29:38.576
Got to go.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.116
Very important parent
coming through.

29:40.151 --> 29:43.317
I don't know what you're
saying, but good luck!

29:43.352 --> 29:45.088
Morning.

29:45.123 --> 29:48.058
PHUDDLE: Coming right up, Mia.

29:48.093 --> 29:50.357
At last.

29:50.392 --> 29:51.523
Here we go, Mia.

29:51.558 --> 29:53.558
I just have to
install this final--

29:53.593 --> 29:54.999
whatever this is.

29:55.034 --> 29:56.528
Will it make it go faster?

29:56.563 --> 29:59.069
No, but it will make us go.

29:59.104 --> 30:04.140
[laughs] Yes, yes.

30:04.175 --> 30:05.570
Any second now.

30:15.219 --> 30:16.152
Woo-hoo-hoo!

30:16.187 --> 30:16.988
That's it.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.286
We're good to go.

30:18.321 --> 30:19.650
You rock, Phuddle.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.487
[neighs]

30:21.522 --> 30:24.457
Whoa, someone's
keen to meet Stormy.

30:24.492 --> 30:26.492
Come on, Iko.

30:26.527 --> 30:28.901
Please stow all hooves,
wings, and magical artifacts

30:28.936 --> 30:29.902
for takeoff.

30:29.937 --> 30:33.235
And get ready to be history!

30:33.270 --> 30:36.040
You mean get ready
to make history, right?

30:36.075 --> 30:38.306
Huh, probably.

30:38.341 --> 30:39.670
Probably?

30:39.705 --> 30:42.915
[music playing]

30:44.314 --> 30:45.676
Bye, Mo.

30:45.711 --> 30:46.578
Bye, Yuko.

30:46.613 --> 30:48.679
See you on Lotus Island!

30:48.714 --> 30:50.219
Bye, Mia.

30:50.254 --> 30:50.648
Good luck!

31:02.299 --> 31:04.002
Looking good.

31:04.037 --> 31:05.531
Doing great.

31:05.566 --> 31:08.534
Just imagine what I could
do with more fingers.

31:08.569 --> 31:10.602
Oh, Mia, can I be next?

31:10.637 --> 31:12.406
Of course you can, Phuddle.

31:12.441 --> 31:14.639
Every captain
needs a shiny coat.

31:14.674 --> 31:16.278
Oh, yay!

31:16.313 --> 31:17.180
Iko?

31:17.215 --> 31:26.222
[sneezes] Thanks, Mia.

31:26.257 --> 31:26.651
Oh.

31:29.359 --> 31:31.128
Let's see.

31:31.163 --> 31:35.264
Ahem, who needs blankets when we
have my genuine patented warmy

31:35.299 --> 31:36.496
puppies!

31:36.531 --> 31:37.101
Huh?

31:37.136 --> 31:38.003
What?

31:38.038 --> 31:41.072
And one for you, Onchao.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.502
Why do you call
them warmy puppies?

31:42.537 --> 31:44.372
Whoa!

31:44.407 --> 31:48.112
[laughs]

31:48.147 --> 31:49.476
I mean, aren't they great?

31:49.511 --> 31:50.378
No.

31:50.413 --> 31:52.215
I can't move like this.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.250
You sort of can.

31:54.285 --> 31:56.417
Ah!

31:56.452 --> 31:58.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:58.058 --> 32:00.553
Oh.

32:00.588 --> 32:01.488
Ugh.

32:01.523 --> 32:02.291
Oh my.

32:02.326 --> 32:02.687
Phuddle!

32:02.722 --> 32:03.655
Yes?

32:03.690 --> 32:04.755
How do you take them off?

32:04.790 --> 32:05.998
Take them off?

32:06.033 --> 32:08.132
[neighs]

32:08.167 --> 32:10.662
Onchao, oh dear.

32:10.697 --> 32:11.630
[neighs]

32:11.665 --> 32:12.268
Oh!

32:15.108 --> 32:17.240
Ah!

32:17.275 --> 32:18.538
Blankets it is then.

32:18.573 --> 32:19.704
[both laugh]

32:19.739 --> 32:22.014
Yeah.

32:22.049 --> 32:25.017
[music playing]

32:39.297 --> 32:43.101
PHUDDLE: Well, good
morning, sleepyhead.

32:43.136 --> 32:44.366
MIA: Morning, Phuddle.

32:44.401 --> 32:45.730
Have you been up all night?

32:45.765 --> 32:48.238
PHUDDLE: This
captain never sleeps.

32:48.273 --> 32:56.081
[laughs] I've never seen a
sunrise in Centopia before.

32:56.116 --> 32:58.446
You can't see
anything in this fog.

32:58.481 --> 33:01.680
Phuddle, do you even
know where we're going?

33:01.715 --> 33:03.121
Of course.

33:03.156 --> 33:06.223
I just close my eyes
and feel the wind.

33:06.258 --> 33:07.785
Be the wind.

33:07.820 --> 33:08.588
ONCHAO: [farts]

33:08.623 --> 33:13.263
Oh, Onchao!

33:13.298 --> 33:14.165
Ugh.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.067
[neighs]

33:15.102 --> 33:16.299
[gags]

33:16.334 --> 33:17.333
We're doomed.

33:17.368 --> 33:19.434
There's no way we can do this.

33:19.469 --> 33:20.699
Hey, Iko.

33:20.734 --> 33:21.469
What?

33:21.504 --> 33:23.801
Whoa, it's OK.

33:23.836 --> 33:24.670
We'll get there.

33:24.705 --> 33:25.803
Just relax.

33:25.838 --> 33:26.771
Relax?

33:26.806 --> 33:28.377
How can I?

33:28.412 --> 33:30.577
My home has been conquered
by an ancient evil toad,

33:30.612 --> 33:34.317
and the fate of Centopia is
in the hands of that guy.

33:34.352 --> 33:40.455
[laughs] [gags] Ah.

33:40.490 --> 33:42.457
He's doing his best.

33:42.492 --> 33:44.756
[sighs] I know.

33:44.791 --> 33:48.826
It's just, why would
the oracle choose us?

33:48.861 --> 33:50.333
Choose me?

33:50.368 --> 33:52.797
The day Toxor I
escaped I was just

33:52.832 --> 33:54.799
bringing the empress her lunch.

33:54.834 --> 33:58.110
OK, so--

33:58.145 --> 34:01.311
So how can I be
meant to save Centopia?

34:01.346 --> 34:02.444
The oracle is wrong.

34:02.479 --> 34:04.182
The oracle is never wrong.

34:04.217 --> 34:05.744
It is this time.

34:05.779 --> 34:09.451
My dad, he was a real hero.

34:09.486 --> 34:12.652
And now I can't even
ask him what to do.

34:12.687 --> 34:14.753
I just feel so--

34:14.788 --> 34:15.391
Lost?

34:19.595 --> 34:21.628
I didn't even
get to say goodbye.

34:21.663 --> 34:23.399
I understand.

34:23.434 --> 34:26.402
I lost my parents
three years ago.

34:26.437 --> 34:30.142
They drowned.

34:30.177 --> 34:32.903
Oh, Mia.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.575
I'm really sorry.

34:34.610 --> 34:38.249
After they died they--

34:38.284 --> 34:39.811
they left me this.

34:39.846 --> 34:44.387
But how did your parents get
a bracelet from Lotus Island?

34:44.422 --> 34:46.851
I-- I don't know.

34:46.886 --> 34:49.788
They must have wanted me
to come to this world.

34:49.823 --> 34:51.526
So what do we do now?

34:51.561 --> 34:53.198
We save it.

34:53.233 --> 34:54.595
[thunder]

34:54.630 --> 34:55.728
PHUDDLE: Oh my!

34:55.763 --> 34:57.169
Breeze is picking up.

34:57.204 --> 34:59.270
Looks like we found Stormy.

34:59.305 --> 34:59.732
PHUDDLE: Yay.

35:11.845 --> 35:12.943
Ugh.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.912
Captain's log, my
greatest regret

35:14.947 --> 35:18.421
is that I didn't bring any mayo
for my bile turnip sandwiches.

35:18.456 --> 35:19.521
MIA: Shh.

35:19.556 --> 35:20.291
Hear that?

35:24.660 --> 35:26.825
We're not alone.

35:26.860 --> 35:27.727
Ship ahoy!

35:32.305 --> 35:34.305
That looks like a
Lotus Island ship.

35:44.614 --> 35:46.350
Hey, do you need help?

35:46.385 --> 35:46.845
No.

35:46.880 --> 35:47.912
Groundlings!

35:47.947 --> 35:49.980
We've got to get out of here.

35:50.015 --> 35:53.423
It's Glitchy!

35:53.458 --> 35:55.524
Phuddle, go!

35:55.559 --> 35:56.723
I can't.

35:56.758 --> 35:58.329
They got it hook,
line, and sinker.

35:58.364 --> 35:59.627
She-Elf, get her.

36:06.669 --> 36:07.734
Iko, look out!

36:07.769 --> 36:10.308
Naughty elf.

36:10.343 --> 36:11.573
Don't breath in the smoke.

36:11.608 --> 36:13.707
It'll turn you into one of them.

36:13.742 --> 36:15.709
GLITCH: [laughs]

36:15.744 --> 36:20.285
[neighs]

36:20.320 --> 36:22.353
Onchao!

36:22.388 --> 36:23.321
Bye.

36:23.356 --> 36:23.981
Now go.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.258
Get glitch She-Elf.

36:26.293 --> 36:27.017
Get elves!

36:27.052 --> 36:28.359
Yeah!

36:28.394 --> 36:29.789
Get the elf!

36:29.824 --> 36:31.791
[indistinct]...rubbish elves!

36:31.826 --> 36:32.891
[laughs]

36:32.926 --> 36:34.794
Easy there.

36:34.829 --> 36:35.927
Oh.

36:35.962 --> 36:37.830
Ooh.

36:37.865 --> 36:39.029
It wasn't me.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.768
GROUNDLING: Come
here, you little--

36:41.803 --> 36:43.000
Whoa there.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.276
Easy, girl.

36:44.311 --> 36:46.003
You are a girl, aren't you?

36:46.038 --> 36:46.641
Oh.

36:49.613 --> 36:51.910
Whoa!

36:51.945 --> 36:53.813
[neighs]

36:53.848 --> 36:54.748
Onchao!

36:54.783 --> 36:56.420
No, don't hurt her!

36:59.359 --> 37:02.624
[neighs]

37:02.659 --> 37:03.394
Mine.

37:03.429 --> 37:03.889
Give it back.

37:03.924 --> 37:04.791
Naughty elf.

37:04.826 --> 37:05.957
Take that, frog face.

37:05.992 --> 37:06.892
Come on get it.

37:06.927 --> 37:07.563
Yeah.

37:07.598 --> 37:08.663
[laughs]

37:08.698 --> 37:09.664
I can do this.

37:09.699 --> 37:11.567
Go, Mia.

37:11.602 --> 37:13.866
Eat brush, you big boy.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.769
Must have stone!

37:15.804 --> 37:16.374
[thunder]

37:16.409 --> 37:16.770
Huh?

37:16.805 --> 37:17.771
Huh?

37:17.806 --> 37:20.642
[screams] Uh-oh.

37:25.517 --> 37:26.043
Must have--

37:26.078 --> 37:26.747
Hey, no.

37:26.782 --> 37:27.550
--stone.

37:27.585 --> 37:28.419
Give me that.

37:28.454 --> 37:29.321
That's mine.

37:29.356 --> 37:29.948
Bye bye.

37:37.122 --> 37:37.725
See ya.

37:42.127 --> 37:43.533
Glitchy is unstoppable.

37:43.568 --> 37:46.404
No, my sapphire!

37:46.439 --> 37:48.032
All right, Hooky,
ride like the wind.

37:50.971 --> 37:53.444
All hands on deck.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.644
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:55.679 --> 37:56.579
Ah!

37:56.614 --> 37:57.712
Got you, Phuddle.

37:57.747 --> 38:00.550
[screaming]

38:00.585 --> 38:05.016
Captain's log, I wish I
wasn't the captain anymore.

38:05.051 --> 38:06.787
Stormy's Island.

38:06.822 --> 38:09.889
Hold on.

38:09.924 --> 38:13.464
[neighs]

38:13.499 --> 38:13.893
Whoa!

38:17.503 --> 38:19.866
[screaming]

38:29.779 --> 38:31.042
Is everyone OK?

38:31.077 --> 38:33.385
Yeah, I think so.

38:33.420 --> 38:35.552
No, there's one casualty.

38:38.788 --> 38:39.754
[neighs]

38:39.789 --> 38:41.954
Yeah, he took the sapphire.

38:41.989 --> 38:43.021
What?

38:43.056 --> 38:44.660
They got the stone?

38:44.695 --> 38:46.860
And you crashed the ship?

38:46.895 --> 38:47.465
Ugh.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.862
What?

38:48.897 --> 38:50.127
Well, I wasn't the one
throwing lightning bolts.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.161
You were the captain.

38:51.196 --> 38:52.734
You were the pilot.

38:52.769 --> 38:53.999
I didn't see you at the wheel.

38:54.034 --> 38:56.067
Oh, that's not--

38:56.102 --> 38:58.135
well, your haircut makes
you look like a chicken.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.103
What?

38:59.138 --> 39:00.104
Guys, this isn't helping.

39:00.139 --> 39:01.446
[neighs]

39:01.481 --> 39:02.579
We're supposed
to work together.

39:02.614 --> 39:03.877
We are a team.

39:03.912 --> 39:06.583
Ah, well, this team
doesn't have any stones.

39:06.618 --> 39:07.815
We don't have a ship.

39:07.850 --> 39:08.816
We have nothing.

39:08.851 --> 39:10.752
We came for Stormy's stone.

39:10.787 --> 39:11.984
We need to find him.

39:12.019 --> 39:12.985
[neighs]

39:13.020 --> 39:16.021
Yeah, he owes me a new ship!

39:16.056 --> 39:18.925
Wait, where is he?

39:18.960 --> 39:19.860
Yeah, Onchao.

39:19.895 --> 39:20.729
You're right.

39:20.764 --> 39:21.928
Let's fly up there.

39:21.963 --> 39:23.501
We'll get a bird's eye view.

39:23.536 --> 39:25.503
IKO: Yeah.

39:25.538 --> 39:26.669
Come on.

39:26.704 --> 39:29.166
[laughs] Let's go!

39:29.201 --> 39:30.739
Guys, slow down.

39:30.774 --> 39:32.840
I can't fly, remember?

39:32.875 --> 39:35.843
[music playing]

39:50.761 --> 39:52.959
I don't like this.

39:52.994 --> 39:54.059
Chico?

39:54.094 --> 39:55.533
Who brought the monkey?

39:55.568 --> 39:57.733
Ah, he brought himself, Mo.

39:57.768 --> 39:59.768
He just wants to help.

39:59.803 --> 40:02.100
Well, he can help
over there somewhere.

40:02.135 --> 40:04.674
Gubu, fly up and see
where the city is.

40:04.709 --> 40:06.544
We need to know how
far this jungle goes.

40:06.579 --> 40:07.644
Yes, your majesty.

40:14.752 --> 40:16.081
Ah!

40:16.116 --> 40:17.082
What?

40:17.117 --> 40:18.050
[gasps]

40:18.085 --> 40:19.755
Wha?

40:19.790 --> 40:21.592
Gubu, are you OK?

40:21.627 --> 40:24.254
Shh, listen.

40:24.289 --> 40:25.728
[groaning]

40:25.763 --> 40:27.862
What is that?

40:27.897 --> 40:29.259
We have to go help him, Mo.

40:29.294 --> 40:32.163
Gubu, come back.

40:32.198 --> 40:33.197
Sorry!

40:33.232 --> 40:34.605
Give me that.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.233
Everybody split up
into small groups.

40:36.268 --> 40:36.904
Fan out.

40:36.939 --> 40:37.806
Ah.

40:37.841 --> 40:39.269
Yuko, you stay with me.

40:39.304 --> 40:42.206
No one flies until we find
Gubu and this Lotus city.

40:42.241 --> 40:44.978
Everybody stay within shouting
distance of each other.

40:45.013 --> 40:47.145
[monkey noises]

40:47.180 --> 40:50.181
[music playing]

41:01.700 --> 41:03.667
What?

41:03.702 --> 41:04.998
What happened here?

41:05.033 --> 41:05.900
Nothing good.

41:11.303 --> 41:12.874
[monkey noises]

41:12.909 --> 41:16.174
Yep, I've got a bad feeling
about this too, Chico.

41:16.209 --> 41:18.682
[screaming]

41:20.587 --> 41:24.083
One of the groups
is in trouble.

41:24.118 --> 41:26.558
[shouting]

41:27.220 --> 41:28.021
More than one group.

41:28.056 --> 41:29.759
This way.

41:29.794 --> 41:31.321
[shouting]

41:31.356 --> 41:32.729
No, this way.

41:32.764 --> 41:34.291
Yuko, wait.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.029
But they need our help.

41:36.064 --> 41:37.261
I can't see them, Yuko.

41:37.296 --> 41:39.670
Where are you?

41:39.705 --> 41:40.836
Yuko!

41:40.871 --> 41:41.265
Yuko!

41:54.115 --> 41:55.818
Whoa.

41:55.853 --> 41:57.182
Someone likes jewelry.

41:57.217 --> 41:59.987
PHUDDLE: Yeah, me!

42:00.022 --> 42:01.989
[laughs] Ooh.

42:04.928 --> 42:08.259
[music playing]

42:09.262 --> 42:10.195
Whoa.

42:10.230 --> 42:11.064
Stormy.

42:11.099 --> 42:12.065
Well, he looks nice.

42:14.971 --> 42:19.270
Thunder, how many more
thieves must I smite today?

42:19.305 --> 42:19.875
No.

42:19.910 --> 42:20.711
No, no.

42:20.746 --> 42:21.613
We're not thieves.

42:21.648 --> 42:22.779
Please, don't smite us.

42:22.814 --> 42:24.374
Yes, we hate being--

42:24.409 --> 42:25.243
smote.

42:25.278 --> 42:27.850
Wait, you can talk?

42:27.885 --> 42:28.983
You can speak elf?

42:29.018 --> 42:32.283
Of course I can,
you silly thing.

42:32.318 --> 42:36.089
I am the great Storm unicorn.

42:36.124 --> 42:37.860
Whoa!

42:37.895 --> 42:40.962
I can speak many
tongues of Centopia.

42:40.997 --> 42:42.799
I can speak dragon.

42:42.834 --> 42:46.638
[speaking dragon] Duck.

42:46.673 --> 42:51.071
[quacking] Pig.

42:51.106 --> 42:55.779
[oinking] Crab.

42:55.814 --> 42:58.243
Well, actually, crabs
don't really talk.

42:58.278 --> 43:00.916
It's more of an
interpretive little shuffle.

43:00.951 --> 43:02.181
Sort of the [gibberish].

43:07.089 --> 43:08.055
Hmm, what?

43:08.090 --> 43:08.726
Oh.

43:08.761 --> 43:09.419
[laughs]

43:09.454 --> 43:11.861
You are thieves!

43:11.896 --> 43:15.194
You're pinching
my precious booty.

43:15.229 --> 43:18.670
It's time to taste the thunder.

43:18.705 --> 43:19.231
No!

43:19.266 --> 43:20.100
Wait, Stormy!

43:20.135 --> 43:20.837
Stop!

43:20.872 --> 43:22.234
Why should I?

43:25.811 --> 43:27.272
Because Onchao is right.

43:27.307 --> 43:29.241
Centopia is in trouble.

43:29.276 --> 43:30.374
We need your help.

43:30.409 --> 43:32.013
My help?

43:32.048 --> 43:34.719
[scoffs] You're lying again.

43:34.754 --> 43:36.985
No one ever needs my help.

43:44.764 --> 43:45.730
[neighs]

43:45.765 --> 43:47.160
Toxor's back?

43:47.195 --> 43:49.129
So I didn't imagine it.

43:49.164 --> 43:51.802
He was in my drinking bowl.

43:51.837 --> 43:54.365
And the key to defeating
him is in your necklace.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.906
You want the emerald of hope?

43:56.941 --> 43:57.434
No, no, no.

43:57.469 --> 43:58.809
I can't.

43:58.844 --> 43:59.777
Why not?

43:59.812 --> 44:01.845
It's all I have.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.880
You think I don't want to help?

44:03.915 --> 44:05.981
You think I don't
want to go back

44:06.016 --> 44:09.116
to have a life and friends?

44:09.151 --> 44:12.251
I've been banished!

44:12.286 --> 44:13.791
Banished?

44:13.826 --> 44:14.451
Why?

44:14.486 --> 44:16.288
I rained.

44:16.323 --> 44:19.291
I rained on a parade.

44:19.326 --> 44:21.194
It was an accident.

44:21.229 --> 44:24.901
Everything was ruined, and the
other unicorns were so mad.

44:24.936 --> 44:28.498
I ran off before they
could yell at me.

44:28.533 --> 44:31.105
Wait, so you banished you?

44:31.140 --> 44:33.140
Well, I had to.

44:33.175 --> 44:34.911
I couldn't risk the humiliation!

44:37.916 --> 44:41.214
Mia, is he shrinking?

44:41.249 --> 44:43.315
He's crying himself out.

44:43.350 --> 44:47.990
This shiny rock
is all I have now.

44:48.025 --> 44:51.356
That and also
millions of others.

44:51.391 --> 44:55.899
But I'd trade it all for
friends like yours, Mia.

44:55.934 --> 44:57.296
Except the hair.

44:57.331 --> 44:58.935
The hair stays.

44:58.970 --> 45:01.872
Where I come from, unicorns
are rare and precious.

45:01.907 --> 45:04.303
So just let it all out.

45:04.338 --> 45:06.173
Feels good, huh?

45:06.208 --> 45:08.076
It does.

45:08.111 --> 45:09.440
It really does.

45:09.475 --> 45:12.113
I am precious.

45:12.148 --> 45:13.345
Thank you.

45:13.380 --> 45:14.181
No, no.

45:14.216 --> 45:15.215
Don't cry, Stormy.

45:15.250 --> 45:17.855
You'll disappear.

45:17.890 --> 45:20.957
Don't tell me how to feel!

45:20.992 --> 45:22.288
Just go.

45:22.323 --> 45:23.927
I'll be fine.

45:23.962 --> 45:25.390
No, please.

45:25.425 --> 45:27.425
Come with us to Lotus Island.

45:27.460 --> 45:31.869
We need the stone, but
we need you too, Stormy.

45:31.904 --> 45:33.530
Do you need me?

45:33.565 --> 45:35.070
Really?

45:35.105 --> 45:37.171
You are the great and
powerful storm unicorn.

45:37.206 --> 45:38.337
You didn't ruin the parade.

45:38.372 --> 45:40.405
You are the parade.

45:40.440 --> 45:43.342
Yes, Centopia needs you.

45:43.377 --> 45:45.113
Centopia needs me.

45:45.148 --> 45:47.412
Then what are we waiting for?

45:47.447 --> 45:51.548
Lotus Island, here we come.

45:51.583 --> 45:55.992
Time to ride the rainbow.

45:56.027 --> 45:58.995
Woo-hoo!

45:59.030 --> 45:59.424
Whoa!

46:08.369 --> 46:10.600
I always wanted to
travel at lightspeed.

46:10.635 --> 46:12.503
Woo-hoo!

46:12.538 --> 46:13.141
Yes!

46:15.640 --> 46:17.574
Is it just me or does
this rainbow taste like--

46:17.609 --> 46:18.949
Fuzzberries, yes.

46:18.984 --> 46:21.446
It's my own special recipe.

46:21.481 --> 46:22.854
Goes well with chocolate.

46:25.452 --> 46:27.320
Whoa, nice.

46:27.355 --> 46:30.961
Thanks for sticking
with the mission.

46:30.996 --> 46:34.063
Well, it's like you
said, we're a team.

46:34.098 --> 46:35.526
We stick together.

46:35.561 --> 46:38.199
[neighs]

46:38.234 --> 46:40.465
Lotus Island dead ahead.

46:47.177 --> 46:50.442
[laughs] Well done.

46:50.477 --> 46:51.377
Master ask.

46:51.412 --> 46:52.642
Glitch deliver.

46:52.677 --> 46:53.643
Where's the other one?

46:53.678 --> 46:54.248
Huh?

46:54.283 --> 46:55.051
One?

46:55.086 --> 46:55.645
That one?

46:55.680 --> 46:57.086
No, the other one.

46:57.121 --> 46:58.087
Not that one?

46:58.122 --> 46:59.550
I asked for two stones.

46:59.585 --> 47:01.288
Where's Stormy's stone?

47:01.323 --> 47:03.257
What about pretty blue stone?

47:03.292 --> 47:04.522
It's so pretty.

47:04.557 --> 47:07.261
Glitch!

47:07.296 --> 47:09.098
Where's the third stone?

47:09.133 --> 47:10.968
Um, don't know exactly.

47:11.003 --> 47:12.332
Oh!

47:12.367 --> 47:14.906
What kind of useless
hedge goon can't

47:14.941 --> 47:18.074
defeat a couple of elf
kids and a crybaby unicorn?

47:18.109 --> 47:19.405
Unicorn was mean.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.440
And not just any
elf kids, master.

47:21.475 --> 47:23.376
Strong and brave.

47:23.411 --> 47:26.577
And brave enough to
beat the unicorn.

47:26.612 --> 47:28.953
Brave enough to come here.

47:28.988 --> 47:31.252
Oh, of course, silly me.

47:31.287 --> 47:34.156
They'll just defeat
the Storm unicorn,

47:34.191 --> 47:38.127
ride it's magical rainbow
all the way to my door step.

47:38.162 --> 47:40.063
[neighs]

47:44.630 --> 47:49.138
Oh look, the storm unicorn's
magical rainbow and they--

47:49.173 --> 47:51.338
whoa, what is that?

47:51.373 --> 47:53.241
A goat?

47:53.276 --> 47:55.078
Oh, master was right.

47:55.113 --> 47:57.410
Master is so wise.

47:57.445 --> 47:58.312
Glitch get troops.

47:58.347 --> 48:00.215
Get stone.

48:00.250 --> 48:02.184
Uh, no.

48:02.219 --> 48:05.451
You want something done.

48:05.486 --> 48:06.485
Hurry up, Glitch.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.288
Coming, master.

48:15.034 --> 48:17.595
This can't be right.

48:17.630 --> 48:19.465
I don't recognize anything.

48:19.500 --> 48:22.039
MIA: Are we sure we're
in the right place?

48:22.074 --> 48:24.272
My rainbow's never wrong.

48:24.307 --> 48:26.373
Huh, there's Toxor's cave.

48:26.408 --> 48:27.638
STORMY: Brace for landing!

48:34.218 --> 48:37.681
PHUDDLE: Here we go!

48:37.716 --> 48:39.386
Phuddle, are you OK?

48:39.421 --> 48:40.552
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

48:40.587 --> 48:42.422
Don't you worry about this, Pan.

48:42.457 --> 48:44.127
So, Lotus Island.

48:44.162 --> 48:46.393
It's nice.

48:46.428 --> 48:48.494
It's no main island, am I right?

48:48.529 --> 48:50.364
The flowers.

48:50.399 --> 48:52.366
The trees.

48:52.401 --> 48:54.566
Toxor's destroyed everything.

48:54.601 --> 48:58.207
Find Yuko and Mo.

48:58.242 --> 49:00.440
No, we're so close.

49:00.475 --> 49:02.244
We can end this now.

49:02.279 --> 49:04.048
We'll sneak in and
steal the stones

49:04.083 --> 49:07.348
back right from under his nose.

49:07.383 --> 49:09.086
Where did that come from?

49:09.121 --> 49:09.779
Ah!

49:09.814 --> 49:11.187
Fly.

49:11.222 --> 49:14.091
I wouldn't if I were you.

49:14.126 --> 49:17.721
At this range, they won't miss.

49:17.756 --> 49:20.394
Glitch, get me the last stone.

49:20.429 --> 49:21.527
Yes, master.

49:21.562 --> 49:23.694
Hand it over, little unicorn.

49:23.729 --> 49:24.596
Never!

49:24.631 --> 49:26.664
Oh, don't worry, Stormy.

49:26.699 --> 49:28.732
I'll look after it.

49:28.767 --> 49:32.274
It will be joining the
others in the pool of fear

49:32.309 --> 49:35.178
where no creatures dare to go.

49:35.213 --> 49:36.245
[laughs]

49:36.280 --> 49:38.346
Ground them all, Glitch.

49:38.381 --> 49:39.281
And get me that stone.

49:39.316 --> 49:43.087
[neighs]

49:43.122 --> 49:44.220
We're a team.

49:44.255 --> 49:45.452
We stick together.

49:45.487 --> 49:48.686
Get me that stone now, fools!

49:48.721 --> 49:49.456
Hey.

49:49.491 --> 49:50.094
Give it back.

49:50.129 --> 49:50.655
Mine.

49:50.690 --> 49:53.196
I need it more.

49:53.231 --> 49:54.362
I'll take that.

49:54.397 --> 49:54.758
Ah!

49:54.793 --> 49:55.396
Phuddle!

49:59.864 --> 50:00.599
Eat lightning!

50:03.241 --> 50:04.537
Stormy, no!

50:04.572 --> 50:05.769
Stormy!

50:05.804 --> 50:08.376
Not my shiny rock!

50:08.411 --> 50:09.113
My stone.

50:09.148 --> 50:09.740
I've got it.

50:09.775 --> 50:12.710
Let's fly.

50:12.745 --> 50:15.251
[coughs]

50:15.286 --> 50:16.615
Oh no.

50:16.650 --> 50:19.552
[neighs]

50:19.587 --> 50:21.125
Iko.

50:21.160 --> 50:22.225
Iko!

50:22.260 --> 50:24.227
Stone.

50:24.262 --> 50:28.132
[laughs] I'll take that.

50:28.167 --> 50:30.101
Thank you.

50:30.136 --> 50:31.762
Back in your bog,
you rubbish toad.

50:34.470 --> 50:35.106
Yuko, Mo!

50:37.737 --> 50:42.113
Guys, how many times do I
have to tell you I can't fly!

50:42.148 --> 50:43.444
Ah!

50:43.479 --> 50:46.711
Oh, Onchao.

50:46.746 --> 50:48.614
But Iko's still down there.

50:51.916 --> 50:54.092
[laughs]

50:58.329 --> 50:59.427
We have to go back.

50:59.462 --> 51:00.626
We need Iko.

51:00.661 --> 51:02.661
We can't save
Centopia without him.

51:02.696 --> 51:04.300
We can't.

51:04.335 --> 51:06.797
Toxor's forces are too
strong for a direct attack.

51:06.832 --> 51:10.768
But we can use the Main
Island elves, right, Mo?

51:10.803 --> 51:12.638
Sorry, Mia.

51:12.673 --> 51:14.178
They're gone.

51:14.213 --> 51:15.707
Yeah, we were attacked
as soon as we got here.

51:15.742 --> 51:18.248
Only a few of us
managed to escape.

51:18.283 --> 51:19.513
Oh no.

51:19.548 --> 51:22.912
No, and Toxor's got
all the stones now.

51:22.947 --> 51:27.323
He's going to throw them
into the pool of fear!

51:27.358 --> 51:29.919
Oh boy, is he crying again?

51:29.954 --> 51:32.130
[horn blowing]

51:36.400 --> 51:38.301
Oh, they're leaving.

51:38.336 --> 51:39.335
Did we win?

51:39.370 --> 51:41.238
Toxor is rallying his forces.

51:41.273 --> 51:42.932
We mustn't give up yet.

51:42.967 --> 51:44.406
Come on.

51:44.441 --> 51:46.837
[music playing]

51:57.388 --> 51:59.685
Well, that's it then.

51:59.720 --> 52:01.720
I'm officially unstoppable.

52:01.755 --> 52:11.499
[laughs] Oh.

52:11.534 --> 52:15.239
Honestly though, I thought
this would feel better.

52:15.274 --> 52:16.933
Ah!

52:16.968 --> 52:23.742
[coughs] The prisoners
are waiting, master.

52:23.777 --> 52:25.546
Prisoners?

52:25.581 --> 52:27.449
I mean, your army.

52:27.484 --> 52:28.978
They're outside.

52:29.013 --> 52:29.682
Oh yes.

52:29.717 --> 52:30.287
Good.

52:30.322 --> 52:32.454
Great.

52:32.489 --> 52:35.787
You are loyal to me
aren't you, Glitch?

52:35.822 --> 52:38.229
Is there another option?

52:38.264 --> 52:39.824
Oh, no.

52:39.859 --> 52:41.496
Never mind.

52:41.531 --> 52:45.500
Now I just need to
squash that Lotus queen

52:45.535 --> 52:47.832
and those last remaining elves.

52:47.867 --> 52:50.472
[laughing]

52:51.871 --> 52:54.839
[music playing]

53:07.755 --> 53:10.492
Welcome to Lotus
City, friends.

53:10.527 --> 53:12.923
I wish it were under
better circumstances.

53:12.958 --> 53:16.564
Oh, it is stunning!

53:16.599 --> 53:18.599
I live in a tree.

53:18.634 --> 53:21.668
Mia, Mo told me of the oracle.

53:21.703 --> 53:26.871
You, faraway child, are our
only chance of true victory.

53:26.906 --> 53:30.479
But it-- it can't be.

53:30.514 --> 53:32.283
It must be wrong.

53:32.318 --> 53:33.911
All I've done is fail.

53:33.946 --> 53:35.385
Hey, hey, hey.

53:35.420 --> 53:36.287
Mia.

53:36.322 --> 53:37.849
Trust in the oracle.

53:37.884 --> 53:40.016
Only you can retrieve
the stones, Mia.

53:40.051 --> 53:43.459
I tried, but it wasn't enough.

53:43.494 --> 53:46.462
I lost the sapphire.

53:46.497 --> 53:48.332
Iko is gone because of me.

53:48.367 --> 53:51.434
[neighs]

53:51.469 --> 53:52.897
Don't cry, Mia.

53:52.932 --> 53:56.472
Mo, Yuko, take everyone
to the palace walls.

53:56.507 --> 53:58.606
You're in charge
of the defenses.

53:58.641 --> 53:59.970
Come.

54:00.005 --> 54:01.543
I have something to show you.

54:04.845 --> 54:09.617
Well, right, you, guard, how
many troops remain in the city?

54:09.652 --> 54:13.489
Oh, three lotus squadrons
and a handful of elves

54:13.524 --> 54:16.360
from Main Island.

54:16.395 --> 54:17.526
Don't forget me.

54:17.561 --> 54:20.089
I'm the great storm unicorn.

54:20.124 --> 54:21.530
You're not a ponycorn?

54:21.565 --> 54:22.696
Ponycorn?

54:22.731 --> 54:24.060
Ah, let me at him!

54:24.095 --> 54:24.797
YUKO: Phuddle!

54:24.832 --> 54:25.699
Yes.

54:25.734 --> 54:27.096
We need an invention.

54:27.131 --> 54:29.098
Something that's going to
stop Toxor's groundings

54:29.133 --> 54:30.374
in their tracks.

54:30.409 --> 54:31.441
An invention.

54:31.476 --> 54:32.772
Of course.

54:32.807 --> 54:34.906
Excuse me.

54:34.941 --> 54:35.676
Pants.

54:35.711 --> 54:36.842
I brought pants?

54:36.877 --> 54:38.415
I don't even wear pants!

54:38.450 --> 54:39.075
Oh, think, Phuddle.

54:39.110 --> 54:40.879
Think!

54:40.914 --> 54:44.014
All these tools, there has to
be something I can do to help.

54:44.049 --> 54:44.751
What about this?

54:44.786 --> 54:45.620
No.

54:45.655 --> 54:46.522
Oh, that's no good.

54:46.557 --> 54:47.358
Oh, that'll never work.

54:47.393 --> 54:48.051
Oh, this.

54:48.086 --> 54:50.658
Oh, but I need a tack.

54:50.693 --> 54:51.692
Oh boy.

54:51.727 --> 54:53.826
What the-- get me out of this.

54:53.861 --> 54:55.894
[gasps]

54:55.929 --> 54:58.567
I'm so sorry.

54:58.602 --> 55:01.064
What is this thing?

55:01.099 --> 55:04.441
I can't move.

55:04.476 --> 55:05.508
Yes!

55:05.543 --> 55:07.543
Oh, Phuddle, that's brilliant!

55:07.578 --> 55:08.808
Yes.

55:08.843 --> 55:09.875
Can you make a lot
more of those things?

55:09.910 --> 55:11.448
Well, I'll need a workshop.

55:11.483 --> 55:13.615
Does the empress
have a workshop?

55:13.650 --> 55:15.716
She has a special
machinery room, sir.

55:15.751 --> 55:17.146
Yes, that'll do.

55:17.181 --> 55:22.019
[laughs] Huh?

55:22.054 --> 55:28.564
[laughs] Hammers,
sprockets, winches.

55:28.599 --> 55:29.961
Oh my!

55:29.996 --> 55:33.635
[laughs] And where do you
keep your springy parts?

55:36.541 --> 55:39.509
[music playing]

55:55.054 --> 56:00.464
[laughs] Smoke them
out, my groundlings.

56:00.499 --> 56:02.829
[horn blowing]

56:09.101 --> 56:10.540
What is this place?

56:10.575 --> 56:12.443
The hall of heroes.

56:12.478 --> 56:15.941
And there is someone in
here you need to see.

56:15.976 --> 56:17.778
Is that Toxor?

56:17.813 --> 56:20.550
Yes, lord of the lilies.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.618
He was wise and kind.

56:22.653 --> 56:24.488
He looks so happy.

56:24.523 --> 56:25.819
What happened to him?

56:25.854 --> 56:28.855
He was consumed by
hatred for all elves

56:28.890 --> 56:30.626
because he could not fly.

56:30.661 --> 56:34.498
And that's the hero of
Centopia stopping Toxor.

56:34.533 --> 56:36.797
Look closely at her, Mia.

56:36.832 --> 56:38.469
What else do you see?

56:38.504 --> 56:41.538
She has a bracelet
just like I do.

56:41.573 --> 56:43.606
YUBA: It's the
same bracelet, Mia.

56:43.641 --> 56:45.234
I made it for her.

56:45.269 --> 56:49.843
But that means the
hero was my mother!

56:49.878 --> 56:51.779
Yes, Mia.

56:51.814 --> 56:56.179
You are the faraway child
come home to save us all.

56:56.214 --> 56:57.048
It's me?

56:57.083 --> 56:58.115
Yes.

56:58.150 --> 56:59.820
That's my mom and dad.

56:59.855 --> 57:02.493
I see your mother's
courage in you, Mia.

57:02.528 --> 57:04.121
You can do this.

57:04.156 --> 57:08.158
But without Iko
how can I succeed?

57:08.193 --> 57:09.797
[horn blowing]

57:09.832 --> 57:13.130
Destiny will reveal itself
once you have the stones.

57:13.165 --> 57:14.131
Come.

57:14.166 --> 57:16.133
[horn blowing]

57:19.072 --> 57:22.513
[laughs] Show no mercy.

57:28.213 --> 57:29.586
Whoa!

57:29.621 --> 57:30.015
Ah!

57:33.251 --> 57:34.558
Give them all you've got!

57:42.095 --> 57:43.094
[gasps]

57:45.868 --> 57:46.999
Onchao!

57:47.034 --> 57:48.803
Wow, get the baby unicorn.

57:48.838 --> 57:50.068
Who are you calling a baby?

57:50.103 --> 57:51.168
I'm not a baby.

57:51.203 --> 57:53.841
Going to get you!

57:53.876 --> 57:55.271
Oh, big unicorn!

57:55.306 --> 57:56.580
There's too many of them.

57:56.615 --> 57:57.108
Get them!

57:57.143 --> 57:58.208
Mo, come on.

57:58.243 --> 57:59.143
Back to the city.

58:02.214 --> 58:05.622
[horn blowing]

58:06.823 --> 58:09.021
This passage will
lead you outside.

58:09.056 --> 58:12.255
Pass the groundlings and
fly as fast as you can.

58:12.290 --> 58:14.763
The pool of fear will
play tricks on you,

58:14.798 --> 58:16.699
warping your mind.

58:16.734 --> 58:21.066
Remember your courage, Mia,
and you'll find the stones.

58:21.101 --> 58:21.704
OK.

58:37.216 --> 58:40.118
Oh no.

58:40.153 --> 58:43.858
[gasps] Whoa.

58:43.893 --> 58:45.321
I've got this, Mia.

58:45.356 --> 58:46.190
Go.

58:46.225 --> 58:47.059
Thanks, Stormy.

58:56.807 --> 58:58.939
Phuddle, are you finished yet?

58:58.974 --> 59:00.039
Two burp springs.

59:00.074 --> 59:01.205
Four wheel screws.

59:01.240 --> 59:02.074
Nearly, Mo.

59:02.109 --> 59:03.680
One more-- [gasps] Duck.

59:03.715 --> 59:06.012
Duck?

59:06.047 --> 59:07.651
Oh wow.

59:12.823 --> 59:14.119
Whoa.

59:14.154 --> 59:15.989
The engage on impact now.

59:16.024 --> 59:17.859
[laughs]

59:17.894 --> 59:20.961
Oh, that is 100% Phuddle.

59:20.996 --> 59:22.193
How many do you have?

59:22.228 --> 59:23.095
Five.

59:23.130 --> 59:23.964
Five?

59:23.999 --> 59:24.602
500!

59:34.174 --> 59:34.909
Retreat.

59:34.944 --> 59:35.646
Get the elves.

59:35.681 --> 59:36.911
Get the elves!

59:36.946 --> 59:38.880
You can't hide!

59:38.915 --> 59:42.752
[laughs] Surrender, elves.

59:42.787 --> 59:45.249
You have no chance
against my forces.

59:55.030 --> 59:58.834
Try these new weapons made by
Centopia's greatest inventor.

59:58.869 --> 59:59.802
How do they work?

59:59.837 --> 1:00:01.001
Just throw them!

1:00:03.401 --> 1:00:04.433
ELF: Yeah!

1:00:04.468 --> 1:00:05.973
MO: Nice work, Phuddle.

1:00:06.008 --> 1:00:07.304
YUKO: Phuddle, you're the best!

1:00:07.339 --> 1:00:09.207
What is this Phuddle?

1:00:12.377 --> 1:00:15.884
[groaning]

1:00:15.919 --> 1:00:18.887
[music playing]

1:00:26.798 --> 1:00:28.864
Take that, you meanies.

1:00:28.899 --> 1:00:30.426
Nice shot!

1:00:30.461 --> 1:00:31.262
That's right.

1:00:31.297 --> 1:00:32.428
Bounce them back.

1:00:32.463 --> 1:00:33.803
Well done, Phuddle.

1:00:33.838 --> 1:00:38.236
Hit them with
everything you have!

1:00:38.271 --> 1:00:39.402
Huh?

1:00:39.437 --> 1:00:41.844
Use the puffy ones as cover.

1:00:45.278 --> 1:00:45.881
Ugh.

1:00:52.285 --> 1:00:54.791
Phuddle, I'm out of puppies.

1:00:54.826 --> 1:00:58.124
Mo, look out!

1:00:58.159 --> 1:00:58.554
Yuko!

1:01:02.427 --> 1:01:04.262
No!

1:01:04.297 --> 1:01:05.494
No, Yuko!

1:01:05.529 --> 1:01:07.397
Yuko!

1:01:07.432 --> 1:01:08.805
Fall back.

1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:10.268
Fly to the main hall.

1:01:10.303 --> 1:01:11.742
We need the high ground.

1:01:16.342 --> 1:01:17.880
PHUDDLE: We're in
so much trouble.

1:01:26.825 --> 1:01:29.826
[music playing]

1:01:55.546 --> 1:01:57.150
[gasps]

1:02:11.496 --> 1:02:13.298
It's just a quick swim.

1:02:13.333 --> 1:02:14.365
Paddle.

1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:16.136
How bad can it be?

1:02:20.241 --> 1:02:21.174
Just get in.

1:02:21.209 --> 1:02:22.307
Get the stones.

1:02:22.342 --> 1:02:25.981
[groans]

1:02:26.016 --> 1:02:28.148
Iko, is that you?

1:02:28.183 --> 1:02:32.119
Must stop elf.

1:02:32.154 --> 1:02:34.352
Iko, it's me, Mia.

1:02:34.387 --> 1:02:35.551
Please!

1:02:35.586 --> 1:02:36.552
I know you remember me.

1:02:36.587 --> 1:02:39.324
Stop, elf.

1:02:39.359 --> 1:02:42.030
Wait, we're a team.

1:02:42.065 --> 1:02:44.164
You don't have to do this, Iko.

1:02:44.199 --> 1:02:48.839
Must stop elf.

1:02:48.874 --> 1:02:50.104
Mia.

1:02:50.139 --> 1:02:52.843
We have to join
forces, remember?

1:02:52.878 --> 1:02:54.009
You're my friend.

1:02:54.044 --> 1:02:56.605
Save Centopia or obey Toxor.

1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:00.510
You have to decide for yourself
and choose your own path now.

1:03:03.251 --> 1:03:05.317
Mia, go.

1:03:29.541 --> 1:03:30.507
What's going on?

1:03:30.542 --> 1:03:32.014
WOMAN'S VOICE: Give up, Mia.

1:03:32.049 --> 1:03:33.576
It's over.

1:03:33.611 --> 1:03:35.182
I have to save Centopia.

1:03:35.217 --> 1:03:37.547
WOMAN'S VOICE: Save Centopia?

1:03:37.582 --> 1:03:39.153
You're no hero.

1:03:39.188 --> 1:03:40.924
I have to try.

1:03:40.959 --> 1:03:42.420
They're counting on me.

1:03:42.455 --> 1:03:45.962
WOMAN'S VOICE: [laughs]
They don't need you.

1:03:45.997 --> 1:03:48.063
They do.

1:03:48.098 --> 1:03:49.361
They do.

1:03:49.396 --> 1:03:51.297
WOMAN'S VOICE: This task
is too hard for you.

1:03:51.332 --> 1:03:54.597
You can't save anyone.

1:03:54.632 --> 1:03:57.567
You can't even save yourself.

1:03:57.602 --> 1:03:59.976
And you couldn't save Iko.

1:04:00.011 --> 1:04:01.175
Stop it.

1:04:01.210 --> 1:04:03.573
WOMAN'S VOICE: You're
just an orphan.

1:04:03.608 --> 1:04:05.146
You'll never be enough.

1:04:05.181 --> 1:04:06.444
I am!

1:04:06.479 --> 1:04:08.248
I am.

1:04:08.283 --> 1:04:12.549
WOMAN'S VOICE: You'll fail, and
everyone will forget about you.

1:04:12.584 --> 1:04:15.684
No, it's not like that.

1:04:15.719 --> 1:04:17.422
WOMAN'S VOICE: No
one waits for you.

1:04:29.601 --> 1:04:31.238
Wait, Grandpa.

1:04:36.014 --> 1:04:37.640
Grandpa is waiting
for me to come home.

1:04:37.675 --> 1:04:39.576
WOMAN'S VOICE: No.

1:04:39.611 --> 1:04:41.083
No, he's not.

1:04:41.118 --> 1:04:43.217
Onchao.

1:04:43.252 --> 1:04:45.120
Phuddle.

1:04:45.155 --> 1:04:47.254
Yuko and Mo.

1:04:47.289 --> 1:04:49.388
Iko.

1:04:49.423 --> 1:04:50.620
They haven't forgotten me.

1:04:50.655 --> 1:04:54.195
WOMAN'S VOICE: No, you're alone.

1:04:54.230 --> 1:04:57.693
If I was alone I'd be scared.

1:04:57.728 --> 1:05:00.069
But I'm never alone.

1:05:00.104 --> 1:05:03.039
All my friends are
always with me.

1:05:03.074 --> 1:05:05.338
I'm not scared.

1:05:05.373 --> 1:05:06.504
I'm Mia.

1:05:06.539 --> 1:05:08.539
I can do this.

1:05:08.574 --> 1:05:11.542
[music playing]

1:05:39.275 --> 1:05:40.505
Mia?

1:05:40.540 --> 1:05:41.275
Mia?

1:05:41.310 --> 1:05:42.573
[sharp inhale]

1:05:42.608 --> 1:05:44.146
[coughing]

1:05:46.117 --> 1:05:47.050
Mia.

1:05:47.085 --> 1:05:51.087
Iko, you came for me.

1:05:51.122 --> 1:05:51.989
Thank you.

1:05:54.818 --> 1:05:56.389
What now?

1:05:56.424 --> 1:05:58.226
Three precious things in hand.

1:05:58.261 --> 1:05:59.293
We've nearly done it.

1:05:59.328 --> 1:06:00.129
Come on.

1:06:00.164 --> 1:06:00.558
Oh.

1:06:06.104 --> 1:06:07.103
Huh?

1:06:07.138 --> 1:06:07.664
No wings.

1:06:10.372 --> 1:06:12.570
Whoa!

1:06:12.605 --> 1:06:15.045
Smack, smack--

1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:15.771
Ah!

1:06:15.806 --> 1:06:16.805
Get elves.

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:18.147
Get the elves.

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:19.049
Stay back.

1:06:19.084 --> 1:06:19.478
Ah!

1:06:26.223 --> 1:06:28.157
[gasps]

1:06:33.098 --> 1:06:36.825
Oh, I got to work
on those landings.

1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:37.595
Stormy!

1:06:37.630 --> 1:06:39.333
Mia!

1:06:39.368 --> 1:06:40.499
You got your powers back.

1:06:40.534 --> 1:06:42.105
Yes.

1:06:42.140 --> 1:06:43.634
Had a little drink from
the lake on the way over.

1:06:43.669 --> 1:06:45.141
Thought you might
need some help.

1:06:45.176 --> 1:06:46.604
We got the stones, Stormy.

1:06:46.639 --> 1:06:48.837
Iko and I need to get to Toxor.

1:06:48.872 --> 1:06:50.740
Well, let's giddy up.

1:07:00.851 --> 1:07:06.393
[laughs] Look at you pathetic
magical flying creatures

1:07:06.428 --> 1:07:08.527
and whatever you are.

1:07:08.562 --> 1:07:09.792
What?

1:07:09.827 --> 1:07:11.662
The pretty prince!

1:07:11.697 --> 1:07:14.764
I thank you for all those
elves from Main Island.

1:07:14.799 --> 1:07:18.339
I really couldn't have taken
this city without them.

1:07:18.374 --> 1:07:22.310
[laughs] Empress
Yuba, guess what?

1:07:22.345 --> 1:07:23.872
I won!

1:07:23.907 --> 1:07:26.875
Once I've grounded you I think
I'll let you do my laundry.

1:07:26.910 --> 1:07:28.415

1:07:28.450 --> 1:07:30.781
STORMY: [neighs]

1:07:34.654 --> 1:07:35.851
Mia!

1:07:35.886 --> 1:07:36.753
Yes, yes.

1:07:36.788 --> 1:07:39.195
Time to razzle dazzle.

1:07:39.230 --> 1:07:40.526
Hold off, Stormy.

1:07:40.561 --> 1:07:42.264
Iko and I have got this.

1:07:42.299 --> 1:07:43.397
You!

1:07:43.432 --> 1:07:45.630
Brave and stupid.

1:07:45.665 --> 1:07:48.633
You'll make the perfect
underling shield.

1:07:48.668 --> 1:07:50.503
My name is Mia.

1:07:50.538 --> 1:07:51.834
My name is Mia.

1:07:51.869 --> 1:07:54.243
I don't care.

1:07:54.278 --> 1:07:56.245
MIA: Well, maybe
you should care.

1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:57.807
My-- my stones!

1:07:57.842 --> 1:07:59.314
How did you-- wait.

1:07:59.349 --> 1:08:01.712
Hey, you, grab those stones now!

1:08:01.747 --> 1:08:03.780
You heard him.

1:08:03.815 --> 1:08:05.617
No, don't grab them!

1:08:08.424 --> 1:08:09.720
Oh, you're going
to get it now.

1:08:13.627 --> 1:08:15.528
Huh?

1:08:15.563 --> 1:08:17.728
Nothing happened.

1:08:17.763 --> 1:08:20.269
Oh no!

1:08:20.304 --> 1:08:21.765
But why?

1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:24.438
Oh, Mia, I really
feel for you.

1:08:24.473 --> 1:08:25.340
[laughs]

1:08:25.375 --> 1:08:27.276
But the oracle, the--

1:08:27.311 --> 1:08:29.476
the new friend.

1:08:29.511 --> 1:08:31.511
Once I make you
into a groundling

1:08:31.546 --> 1:08:33.876
I'll be the only
friend you ever need.

1:08:33.911 --> 1:08:38.287
[laughs] I'll be your friend.

1:08:38.322 --> 1:08:40.322
You're right, Toxor.

1:08:40.357 --> 1:08:42.720
You and I need to be friends.

1:08:42.755 --> 1:08:47.263
[laughs] What are you doing?

1:08:47.298 --> 1:08:47.692
Don't!

1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.209
No, what magic is this?

1:08:59.244 --> 1:09:01.211
Friendship is a risk, Toxor.

1:09:01.246 --> 1:09:02.212
What?

1:09:02.247 --> 1:09:04.346
MIA: I know you feel lonely.

1:09:04.381 --> 1:09:06.447
Just give friendship a chance.

1:09:06.482 --> 1:09:07.778
Stop this magic.

1:09:15.887 --> 1:09:17.656
Take my hand.

1:09:17.691 --> 1:09:19.691
Be my friend.

1:09:19.726 --> 1:09:22.298
Be happy again.

1:09:22.333 --> 1:09:22.727
Happy?

1:09:25.468 --> 1:09:27.237
Just don't let go.

1:09:27.272 --> 1:09:29.998
I-- I feel so--

1:09:30.033 --> 1:09:33.870
so good!

1:09:33.905 --> 1:09:34.904
[music playing]

1:09:47.050 --> 1:09:47.653
Freedom!

1:09:54.398 --> 1:09:56.893
What happened?

1:09:56.928 --> 1:09:57.531
Mia?

1:10:06.641 --> 1:10:07.277
Mia!

1:10:07.312 --> 1:10:07.904
Mia.

1:10:07.939 --> 1:10:09.312
Yuko?

1:10:09.347 --> 1:10:10.907
Mia!

1:10:10.942 --> 1:10:11.611
Thank you.

1:10:11.646 --> 1:10:12.546
You did it!

1:10:12.581 --> 1:10:14.548
We all did together.

1:10:14.583 --> 1:10:14.944
Iko?

1:10:14.979 --> 1:10:15.846
Dad?

1:10:15.881 --> 1:10:17.320
Oh, Iko.

1:10:17.355 --> 1:10:17.815
Dad!

1:10:17.850 --> 1:10:18.585
My boy.

1:10:18.620 --> 1:10:20.455
You're alive!

1:10:20.490 --> 1:10:22.490
Looks like you and
your friends saved us.

1:10:22.525 --> 1:10:23.821
It's so good to see you.

1:10:23.856 --> 1:10:26.054
I'm so proud of you, Iko.

1:10:26.089 --> 1:10:30.729
PHUDDLE: Mia, young lady,
that was really dangerous.

1:10:30.764 --> 1:10:31.994
What happened to the stones?

1:10:32.029 --> 1:10:34.634
They're in pieces.

1:10:34.669 --> 1:10:36.867
I guess there was no other way.

1:10:36.902 --> 1:10:37.835
What?

1:10:37.870 --> 1:10:39.903
But how will you get home?

1:10:39.938 --> 1:10:41.674
I don't know.

1:10:41.709 --> 1:10:45.909
It takes a great warrior to
stand up to a powerful enemy.

1:10:45.944 --> 1:10:50.452
