Supported by attitude clinic.

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:25.468
Shine your attitude, reveals your beauty.

00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:31.939
If you go, I will really jump.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.492
Don't act like this, bro.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.418
The melody that connect our heart together.

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:31.313
I walked away.. just a few steps.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.216
Then p'Fei was gone...

00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:36.581
If I didn't give up,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.157
If I didn't walk away.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.445
P'Fei will not die, right?

00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:46.725
No, it's not your fault.

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.959
Why do you believe me?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.784
I don't know... I just want to believe.

00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:00.673
You probably just want someone in the world to trust you.

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:04.370
Same as me wanting my friends to believe 
that I couldn't see myself.

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:07.694
Thank you, bro

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.385
for believing in me.

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.706
Umm 

00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:14.212
Thank you too, for trusting me

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:13.210
Kiddo

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:52.908
Hey, you awake?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.161
Sorry, am I playing guitar a bit too loud?

00:03:57.826 --> 00:03:58.834
You played it really nice.

00:04:00.888 --> 00:04:02.181
I just wrote a song..

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:07.505
But it's freaking hard when I don't have May beside.

00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:12.360
So...do you want to reunite with P' May , P' Mei?

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:14.559
Of course.

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:18.811
But I'm not brave enough to meet them.

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:21.118
Doing so much shit to them

00:04:22.544 --> 00:04:24.586
Well... since you are here,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.901
Can you check how I look?

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.791
I can't see myself.

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:33.811
Sure, let's see

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:55.273
(Still yelling out loud?)

00:04:56.493 --> 00:05:00.578
(Ready to break through the wall..)

00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:05.722
(There's no one aware or care about you tho.)

00:05:06.924 --> 00:05:09.512
(You're might just want someone..)

00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:18.000
(The one that never know, never see, never judge you nothing)

00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:25.273
(They force you to become a villain..) 

00:05:25.273 --> 00:05:30.160
(An evil without a heart for anyone to love)

00:05:38.814 --> 00:05:39.336
How was it?

00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:41.920
Oh, that's pretty good,

00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:43.874
but...

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:45.978
you didn't look or stared at me at all.

00:05:50.663 --> 00:05:52.637
I don't like looking at people's faces when playing guitar.

00:05:53.696 --> 00:05:54.196
Why?

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.104
I don't know...

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.181
So... try looking into my eyes.

00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:05.310
Hmmm...no,

00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:08.049
Please..

00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:21.076
See! you can do it. Why do you scare to look into other's eye?

00:06:23.047 --> 00:06:23.569
Well...

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:25.715
When I was young..

00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:29.242
My dad used to criticize me

00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:35.709
No confidence at all

00:06:36.453 --> 00:06:37.164
Start over, again

00:06:42.674 --> 00:06:43.174
It's off the beat.

00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:46.107
Start again...concentrate more

00:06:51.908 --> 00:06:52.519
Enough

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.208
Have you remembered anything from the music school?

00:06:57.811 --> 00:07:00.744
You sing over and over, but still being wrong in the same place, the same point

00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:04.165
Are you even embarrassed that you're this suck!

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.751
Tang.. or would you like to try to other fields?

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:14.097
You don't have to be a singer. If you're not good at singing, or if you're not confident.

00:07:15.576 --> 00:07:18.568
Spent a lot of money going to school, how could you let him go other ways?

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.836
Keep practicing singing. If it's still sound stupid, don't stop!

00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:28.234
And do you dare to go for a scholarship of the music school?

00:07:28.624 --> 00:07:29.750
Or being a singer?

00:07:32.106 --> 00:07:33.050
Honey..

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:48.175
Tang..

00:07:48.712 --> 00:07:49.212
Hmmm?

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:52.575
... well,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.428
When I was a kid.

00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:57.431
My parents said that I can't sing well.

00:07:58.487 --> 00:07:59.722
No good to be a singer

00:08:00.778 --> 00:08:02.778
Still, they forced me to keep practicing singing.

00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:06.797
Seriously,

00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:08.146
I want to be a singer.

00:08:09.273 --> 00:08:10.217
I like playing guitar.

00:08:11.773 --> 00:08:13.841
But I just don't like looking at people's faces when playing.

00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:16.292
It made me thinking of them.

00:08:18.486 --> 00:08:19.905
Bro, you sing really well tho.

00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:24.348
I was accused by the whole school that I was a murderer.

00:08:25.577 --> 00:08:27.094
But I wasn't.

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:29.132
Just like you, 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Your parents said you couldn't sing well,

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.782
but actually you're really good at it.

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:37.619
Are you my life coach or something?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.924
Come on!! I'll go live-coach for you today,

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:52.205
What? Going where?

00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:54.060
I'll take you there! Get up real quick!

00:08:54.665 --> 00:08:56.509
Sign your name here please,

00:08:58.122 --> 00:08:58.789
Okay..

00:09:02.726 --> 00:09:04.480
Ok, I will do the pimple injection first.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.384
And then we will go do the treatment up-stairs.

00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:08.456
Does it hurt, doc? 

00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:10.216
It hurts so bad!

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.986
Ok 1 2 3 / Ok done, does it hurt?

00:09:17.677 --> 00:09:19.169
It doesn't hurt at all.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:33.797
Here bro!

00:09:35.547 --> 00:09:36.099
What?

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:38.374
You don't look at your audience when you play,

00:09:39.284 --> 00:09:40.804
so here I am! bringing you to play int front of them.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.533
No way man, 

00:09:46.224 --> 00:09:47.348
Please.. let's try.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.291
Consider as taking me to a sightseeing tour of your city.

00:09:52.482 --> 00:09:52.982
Uh,

00:09:54.268 --> 00:09:55.484
Okay okay!

00:09:56.957 --> 00:09:57.793
Where then?

00:09:58.042 --> 00:09:58.542
there

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:12.949
June : How are you bro?

00:10:13.257 --> 00:10:14.503
June : Neo didn't do anything, right?

00:10:23.227 --> 00:10:24.322
Oh... thanks

00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:26.739
I’ve got your back!

00:10:27.123 --> 00:10:27.662
Okay

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:41.016
There will be a special performance by Tang, from Tang May band.

00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:43.256
Please come join us

00:10:46.624 --> 00:10:50.124
Let's give a big round of applause for him!

00:10:53.283 --> 00:10:54.381
Eh... Nam-Mei

00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:58.103
Are you okay? inviting me out for a walk like this after all that happened..

00:10:58.904 --> 00:10:59.735
Yeah, I'm okay,

00:11:00.314 --> 00:11:02.314
I guess Tang didn't do that on purpose.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.425
And if you were me, you might be even more shocked.

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:08.777
The situation might just be unintentional.

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:11.198
But...isn't it a bit too much?

00:11:12.345 --> 00:11:13.053
Nah I don't think so,

00:11:17.037 --> 00:11:18.820
Wait, is that Tang?

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.190
Why did he come to play here?

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:24.506
Usually, he doesn't like playing in front of a lot of people.

00:11:25.572 --> 00:11:27.572
No matter how many times I invite him, he still won't come.

00:11:30.594 --> 00:11:35.941
(Let her see that my love suits her more)

00:11:36.954 --> 00:11:41.336
(How many tears will it take to make her fall for me?)

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:46.168
(In the end, it's the price...)

00:11:55.207 --> 00:11:56.302
Hi everyone.

00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:58.673
My name is Tang.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.965
I'm the lead singer of the band Tang-May

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:06.694
In fact, there is another guitarist...named May.

00:12:08.803 --> 00:12:12.438
May is a very good guitarist...and also good at song composing.

00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:15.242
When I don't have him, I feel nervous..

00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:17.726
I feel completely at a loss.

00:12:18.933 --> 00:12:21.555
It would be nice if May came to play with me today.

00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:26.736
And our band also has a manager...named Nam-Mei.

00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:30.538
No matter how many times I make mistakes.. how bad I am..

00:12:31.415 --> 00:12:32.857
She was always right there..

00:12:34.234 --> 00:12:36.234
for me and the band,

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:42.180
May..

00:12:47.146 --> 00:12:50.063
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you that May and Nam-Mei would come.

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.262
Umm, it's fine

00:12:56.554 --> 00:12:59.536
I'm sorry that I shocked you yesterday.

00:13:00.774 --> 00:13:03.082
It's okay, but don't worry about me, please worry about May..

00:13:03.564 --> 00:13:04.664
He just...

00:13:11.856 --> 00:13:14.328
You're so bad playing this alone.

00:13:15.081 --> 00:13:17.686
Let me help, so you might get better

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:19.370
That would be awesome!!!

00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:38.915
(Maybe it's the wind that just blows)

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.693
(Maybe it's the clouds floating in the sky)

00:13:43.834 --> 00:13:50.574
(But how it will be, I'm still looking forward that one day the love might come)

00:13:52.506 --> 00:13:55.863
(One day love might come nearby)

00:14:00.567 --> 00:14:02.431
Hey.. there's a lot of people watching the live today.

00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:03.539
and here too

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.153
It's literally because of you guys.

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:10.679
Umm... that's right, I agree!

00:14:13.309 --> 00:14:17.646
Guys... I'm really ashamed for how bad I am..

00:14:19.186 --> 00:14:21.546
Nah. don't use the word "bad"..

00:14:21.546 --> 00:14:24.000
it's actually "asshole" / Too much!

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.373
Damn! Well, I know right..

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.656
I just want to apologize to you guys.

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.047
The whole thing that I didn't give you credit..

00:14:32.927 --> 00:14:34.927
and the thing that I broke the promise of the two of you..

00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:37.229
Thank you for coming here today.

00:14:38.014 --> 00:14:39.218
You don't have to thank me at all.

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:42.429
You should say thanks to Neo, He messaged me to come here.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.830
Otherwise, I probably won't come... Here I have to fool May too,

00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:48.704
Haa? / Yup!

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.497
You again Nam-Mei! And you guys..? are you all fooling me?

00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:57.675
I gotcha... haha. Don't you know? 

00:14:58.483 --> 00:15:00.483
Oh!!! I'm totally dead.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.019
Oh, really got fooled

00:15:03.928 --> 00:15:05.023
You guys..

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.286
Do you still want to continue doing our band?

00:15:10.844 --> 00:15:12.844
Hmm, Do you want to?

00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:16.146
Of course I want to / Me too

00:15:16.734 --> 00:15:18.618
, but May....

00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:26.449
Then... seems like there's no problem! 

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.649
Oh, cheers! / yay!

00:15:38.936 --> 00:15:40.936
(Crying)

00:15:41.427 --> 00:15:43.427
hey, hey, Nam-Mei,

00:15:45.284 --> 00:15:46.185
what's wrong with you?

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.570
I'm glad you guys got back together.

00:15:50.056 --> 00:15:51.915
I haven't slept for many nights.

00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:53.971
Sorry, sorry

00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:56.145
Your fault!

00:15:56.278 --> 00:15:58.143
Look, we won't fight anymore.

00:15:58.339 --> 00:15:59.244
Well, we love each other to death.

00:15:59.274 --> 00:16:00.404
Shake hands...

00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:14.756
When did you text May and Nam-Mei to come? You didn't tell me.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.650
I need to have my own gimmicks bro,

00:16:17.499 --> 00:16:19.854
I took Nam-Mei's IG from your IG.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.783
and I messaged her, that's it.

00:16:23.544 --> 00:16:26.421
And you asked them to come like this... don't you think we would have a fight??

00:16:27.468 --> 00:16:29.468
Well, you told me that you want to reunite with them.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:33.533
Besides, I already knew by just only looking into your eyes.

00:16:34.497 --> 00:16:36.066
that I don't wanna have a fight with your friends

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.607
you master degree of reunion huh!?

00:16:42.882 --> 00:16:43.628
Er.. Neo,

00:16:45.428 --> 00:16:48.725
why don't people in Lamphun believe that you're not the one who did it.

00:16:49.748 --> 00:16:52.374
A guy like you.. shouldn't be able to hurt anyone..

00:16:55.072 --> 00:16:56.900
There are some people who spin the trend on social media.

00:16:58.466 --> 00:17:00.466
People love P'Fei,

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:04.564
Even if the police have evidence that I didn't do it.

00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:09.565
Fei's fans... still don't believe.

00:17:10.173 --> 00:17:11.647
And keep pissing me off

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.944
Even the whole world doesn't believe in me

00:17:15.478 --> 00:17:17.478
it’s just only you who trust..

00:17:19.174 --> 00:17:20.657
that's enough.

00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:52.736
Hey Neo,

00:17:53.337 --> 00:17:56.729
I know how to help you telling people that you didn't kill Fei.

00:17:57.465 --> 00:17:58.189
How, bro?

00:17:59.118 --> 00:17:59.851
Here we go

00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:08.752
Hello, I'm Tang.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:11.011
Now I'm with Neo.

00:18:18.773 --> 00:18:22.351
I want to speak on behalf of Neo, who is being accused of being a murder.

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:25.585
Actually, Neo didn't do anything.

00:18:26.134 --> 00:18:27.376
And also even help me.

00:18:27.945 --> 00:18:30.397
But for those who still do not believe that he is innocent.

00:18:30.723 --> 00:18:33.571
and strongly believe that he is a murderer. That's okay.

00:18:34.053 --> 00:18:36.825
But I want you to ask you to stop spread the fake news now.

00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:46.039
I really hope that you guys will see another side of Neo

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:46.781
as the way I do

00:18:47.246 --> 00:18:50.802
And you guys will know that Neo isn't like what you all thought.

00:18:50.802 --> 00:18:51.746
Thank you.

00:18:57.043 --> 00:19:01.315
I will upload this clip on instagram, Tiktok, Facebook

00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:03.763
In case someone might change their mind.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.227
Thank you so much, bro.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.892
It's alright.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.007
You can go take a shower now. It's a bit stinky!

00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:21.824
Okay

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:42.829
June : Did you see this picture?

00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:47.163
June : It was a notebook that Neo wrote before killing Fei.

00:19:48.866 --> 00:19:54.782
(Because of you! I will kill you P'Fei!! Why you spread rumors to others that we had sex??? Fuck you! I'll kill you! Bastard!)

00:19:56.409 --> 00:19:59.071
Tang : Was that Fei's account?

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:02.677
June : Yes,

00:20:02.981 --> 00:20:04.586
Tang : Is it real?

00:20:04.586 --> 00:20:06.246
June : The classmate said it was Neo's handwriting.

00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:07.951
June :Don't mess with Neo, bro. It's scary.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.740
Tang: Shit.. you right.

00:20:13.347 --> 00:20:17.813
Tang : Don't you text me no more okay? He might know.

00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:48.214
Don't pretend that you sleep!

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.276
Hmm? Are you really sleeping?

00:21:09.042 --> 00:21:09.612
Dude!

00:21:10.171 --> 00:21:11.055
Enough, enough

00:21:11.817 --> 00:21:13.033
Bro!!

00:21:13.033 --> 00:21:14.539
Will you tease me again?

00:21:14.614 --> 00:21:17.068
Do you surrender? / I do...

00:21:17.112 --> 00:21:17.966
You're in charge, sir!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.505
I surrender everything.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.885
I'm sorry...

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.253
I might need to take a shower..

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.965
Aha..

00:22:19.442 --> 00:22:22.305
(You just kill a guy, but why you seem so happy?)

00:22:25.202 --> 00:22:28.183
(Escaping to Chiang Mai make you being cheerful right?)

00:22:28.184 --> 00:22:33.023
(Want us to go see you in Chiang Mai???)

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:37.871
(Bitch like me must be dead rn!)

00:23:07.917 --> 00:23:09.917
What the fuck is this?

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.433
June???

00:23:14.098 --> 00:23:16.772
How can they both have contact of each other?

00:23:20.164 --> 00:23:21.808
June : Hey bro, I'm the guy you met this evening

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:23.809
June : How are u? Neo didn't do anything bad to you right?

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.810
June : Be careful bro!

00:23:26.015 --> 00:23:28.015
June : Are you home?

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:30.167
June : This is the clip of Neo hitting his friend!

00:23:45.473 --> 00:23:46.642
Damn June!!!!!

00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:56.909
What's wrong with you dude..

00:24:08.752 --> 00:24:09.620
OMG!

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.120
Neo!!!

00:24:11.394 --> 00:24:13.394
Hey! Neo, you know what..

00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:18.907
Why do you play around with the gun?

00:24:19.355 --> 00:24:20.450
Do you think I'm playing?

00:24:27.134 --> 00:24:28.293
What the fuck are you doing?

00:24:29.797 --> 00:24:30.953
What the fuck are you then?

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.101
Why are you fucking talk to this asshole June?

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:42.402
Listened to me.

00:24:43.152 --> 00:24:44.270
Before I came to see you

00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:45.774
I met June first.

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:47.805
And he's the one who gave me your address!

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:50.225
Why did you do this?

00:24:51.542 --> 00:24:52.491
June is helpful.

00:24:52.899 --> 00:24:54.899
Anything about you, I always kinda chat with him.

00:24:55.781 --> 00:24:58.107
But I didn't tell you because I don't want you to blame it on him.

00:24:58.226 --> 00:24:58.998
Then do you know?

00:24:59.552 --> 00:25:00.255
This damn June..

00:25:00.562 --> 00:25:02.562
is Fei's brother!

00:25:11.863 --> 00:25:15.127
June : Bro, it's me June..

00:25:26.908 --> 00:25:29.648
Self เราเห็นนาย (I see you)

00:25:30.335 --> 00:25:31.800
Attitude Clinic.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.363
The acne will be gone right away.

00:25:35.473 --> 00:25:37.319
Calm down, miss.

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:39.319
Let the officer work please.

00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:44.873
Fei!!!!

00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:47.289
My son.. Fei!! 

00:25:51.278 --> 00:25:53.278
You know what..

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:55.279
How much love that P'Fei could give you?

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.280
He could do anything for you

00:26:00.924 --> 00:26:03.787
My family has broken down because of you!

00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:05.529
You are the murder!

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.191
Everyone hates you!!

00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:09.191
A guy like you.. have no worth to live!!!

00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:11.192
Nobody wants to be around you!
