01:21.581 --> 01:24.072
Do you find me sadistic?

01:30.523 --> 01:37.486
You know, I'll bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.794
If I wanted to.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.292
You know, kiddo...

01:45.605 --> 01:51.703
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

01:51.778 --> 01:58.081
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

01:59.219 --> 02:03.918
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.458
But not you.

02:10.562 --> 02:12.190
No, kiddo.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.199
At this moment...

02:16.402 --> 02:22.932
This is me at my most
masochistic.

02:23.009 --> 02:27.002
Bill, it's your baby.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.354
~ <i>I was 5 and he was 6</i> ~

02:43.429 --> 02:47.456
~ <i>We rode on horses</i>
<i>made of sticks</i> ~

02:47.534 --> 02:51.026
~ <i>He wore black</i>
<i>and I wore white</i> ~

02:51.104 --> 02:53.038
~ <i>He would always win</i>
<i>the fight</i> ~

02:53.106 --> 02:54.198
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

02:54.274 --> 02:55.707
~ <i>He shot me down</i> ~

02:55.775 --> 02:57.037
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

02:57.110 --> 02:59.203
~ <i>I hit the ground</i> ~

02:59.279 --> 03:00.940
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

03:01.014 --> 03:03.847
~ <i>That awful sound</i> ~

03:03.917 --> 03:05.782
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

03:05.852 --> 03:10.949
~ <i>My baby shot me down</i> ~

03:18.631 --> 03:22.067
~ <i>Seasons came and changed</i>
<i>the time</i> ~

03:22.135 --> 03:26.469
~ <i>When I grew up</i>,
<i>I called him mine</i> ~

03:26.539 --> 03:28.666
~ <i>He would always laugh</i>
<i>and say</i> ~

03:28.741 --> 03:31.938
~ <i>"Remember when</i>
<i>we used to play</i> ? <i>"</i> ~

03:32.011 --> 03:34.479
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

03:34.547 --> 03:35.605
~ <i>I shot you down</i> ~

03:35.682 --> 03:37.411
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

03:37.483 --> 03:38.745
~ <i>You hit the ground</i> ~

03:38.818 --> 03:40.308
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

03:40.386 --> 03:42.854
~ <i>That awful sound</i> ~

03:42.922 --> 03:45.550
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

03:45.625 --> 03:50.494
~ <i>I used to shoot you down</i> ~

03:57.637 --> 04:02.370
~ <i>Music played</i>
<i>and people sang</i> ~

04:02.442 --> 04:07.436
~ <i>Just for me</i>
<i>the church bells rang</i> ~

04:16.488 --> 04:18.389
~ <i>Now he's gone</i> ~

04:18.458 --> 04:21.154
~ <i>I don't know why</i> ~

04:21.226 --> 04:26.062
~ <i>And till this day</i>,
<i>sometimes I cry</i> ~

04:26.132 --> 04:28.225
~ <i>He didn't even say goodbye</i> ~

04:28.301 --> 04:31.896
~ <i>He didn't take the time</i>
<i>to lie</i> ~

04:31.971 --> 04:34.303
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

04:34.374 --> 04:35.807
~ <i>He shot me down</i> ~

04:35.875 --> 04:37.137
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

04:37.210 --> 04:38.700
~ <i>I hit the ground</i> ~

04:38.778 --> 04:41.372
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

04:41.447 --> 04:43.540
~ <i>That awful sound</i> ~

04:43.616 --> 04:46.483
~ <i>Bang bang</i> ~

04:46.552 --> 04:54.687
~ <i>My baby shot me down</i> ~

05:41.874 --> 05:43.842
Coming!

05:43.910 --> 05:46.538
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.433
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

06:52.512 --> 06:55.310
I got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

07:04.957 --> 07:07.050
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

07:08.394 --> 07:11.192
Come on.
Bring it on.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.998
Mommy, I'm home.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.595
Hey, baby.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.573
How was school?

07:57.510 --> 08:00.604
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.614
Oh.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.173
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

08:05.251 --> 08:07.617
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.383
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

08:10.456 --> 08:12.617
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

08:12.692 --> 08:17.061
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

08:22.368 --> 08:26.134
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.173
Hi, honey.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.970
I'm ...

08:30.042 --> 08:31.202
What's your name?

08:34.813 --> 08:36.975
Her name is Nikki.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.640
Nikki.

08:39.485 --> 08:42.352
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.817
How old are you, Nikki?

08:48.227 --> 08:53.164
Nikki, ... asked you
a question.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.291
I'm 4.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.563
4 years old, eh?

08:58.237 --> 09:02.640
You know,
I had a little girl once.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.936
She'd be about 4 now.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.749
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

09:12.818 --> 09:14.115
to talk about.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.278
You can go in your room.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.289
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.790
Okay?

09:21.327 --> 09:23.295
Nikkia!

09:23.362 --> 09:26.160
In your room.
Now.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.975
You want some coffee?

09:41.047 --> 09:43.208
Yeah. Sure.

09:50.222 --> 09:51.985
<i>This Rasadena homemaker's name</i>

09:52.058 --> 09:53.150
<i>is Jeanne Bell</i>.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.819
<i>Her husband is</i>
<i>Dr. Lawrence Bell</i>.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.659
<i>But back when we were</i>
<i>acquainted, four years ago</i>,

09:58.731 --> 10:00.824
<i>her name was Vernita Green</i>.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.494
<i>Her code name was Copperhead</i>.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.366
<i>Mine, Black Mamba</i>.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.996
Do you have a towel?

10:08.341 --> 10:09.831
Yeah.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.307
Thanks.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.439
You still take cream and sugar?

10:16.515 --> 10:17.482
Yeah.

10:20.586 --> 10:23.316
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.755
You suppose correctly.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.020
Look, bitch, I need to know

10:28.094 --> 10:30.858
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.955
You can relax for now.

10:34.266 --> 10:37.793
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

10:39.271 --> 10:40.465
That's being more rational

10:40.539 --> 10:42.871
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

10:42.942 --> 10:47.311
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.348
Not rationality.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.419
Look.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.980
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.549
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.586
You have every right
to want to get even.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.155
No, no, no, no, no.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.291
No.

11:08.367 --> 11:12.167
To get even, even Stephen,

11:12.238 --> 11:18.666
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

11:18.744 --> 11:23.511
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.948
That would be even, Vernita.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.145
That'd be about square.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.280
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.018
But I can't.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.229
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

11:37.296 --> 11:41.255
Oh, great.
I don't care.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.198
Be that as it may,

11:43.269 --> 11:46.295
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

11:46.372 --> 11:51.002
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

11:51.077 --> 11:54.843
Bitch, you can stop right there.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.481
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

11:57.550 --> 11:58.881
before the eyes of your daughter

11:58.951 --> 12:01.511
does not mean that parading her
around in front of me

12:01.587 --> 12:04.647
is gonna inspire sympathy.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.693
You and I have
unfinished business.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.921
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

12:09.995 --> 12:11.485
in the subsequent four years,

12:11.564 --> 12:15.762
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.261
So when do we do this?

12:19.338 --> 12:21.499
It all depends.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.168
When do you want to die?

12:24.243 --> 12:27.110
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

12:27.179 --> 12:28.441
How about tonight, bitch?

12:28.514 --> 12:30.846
Splendid.
Where?

12:30.916 --> 12:33.180
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach our little league

12:33.252 --> 12:35.186
about a mile from here.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.245
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

12:37.323 --> 12:41.350
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.260
And we have us a knife fight.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.355
We won't be bothered.

12:46.432 --> 12:51.335
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.243
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

13:02.314 --> 13:03.747
with an edged weapon.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.977
Fuck you, bitch.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.417
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

13:08.487 --> 13:12.287
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.253
Black Mamba.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.023
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.086
Weapon of choice?

13:19.165 --> 13:21.895
If you want to stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

13:23.669 --> 13:26.103
Very funny, bitch.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.935
Very funny!

14:25.497 --> 14:28.591
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.894
For that, I'm sorry.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.470
But you can take my word for it.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.036
Your mother had it coming.

14:56.729 --> 15:03.225
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

15:07.039 --> 15:08.802
I'll be waiting.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.540
For those regarded as warriors...

15:15.981 --> 15:18.279
When engaged in combat...

15:18.450 --> 15:23.444
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

15:25.958 --> 15:31.021
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...

15:36.101 --> 15:42.631
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

15:48.948 --> 15:54.648
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.709
Come on out to Dallas.

16:21.780 --> 16:25.477
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.815
And next, we got some record.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.650
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.

16:32.725 --> 16:37.719
~ <i>Well</i> ~

16:41.734 --> 16:46.694
~ <i>I'm just a single fellow</i>
<i>with a lot on my mind</i> ~

16:46.772 --> 16:49.172
~ <i>And I'm lookin' for me</i>
<i>a woman</i> ~

16:49.241 --> 16:52.005
~ <i>But she's mighty hard</i>
<i>to find</i> ~

16:52.077 --> 16:54.375
~ <i>Asked my country cousin</i> ~

16:54.446 --> 16:57.347
~ <i>Checked the hottest spots</i>
<i>in town</i> ~

16:57.416 --> 16:59.941
~ <i>Oh, that little bitty woman</i> ~

17:06.358 --> 17:11.295
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.729
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.962
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.573
Give me a figure.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.632
Nine dead bodies.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.304
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.314
Bride. Groom.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.077
Reverend.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.813
Reverend's wife.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.914
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.255
It would appear
somebody objected to this

17:41.326 --> 17:43.658
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

17:48.233 --> 17:52.135
Good gravy, Marie.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.105
What'd I tell you, Pop?

17:59.178 --> 18:02.443
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

18:02.514 --> 18:05.278
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.874
You're in a house of worship.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.385
Sorry, Pop.

18:10.456 --> 18:13.186
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

18:13.258 --> 18:18.127
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.791
Four, maybe five strong.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.891
How can you tell?

18:22.968 --> 18:25.960
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.805
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.402
This is the work of a salty dog.

18:33.479 --> 18:36.209
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.580
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

18:39.651 --> 18:42.916
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

18:42.988 --> 18:46.924
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.930
Who's the bride?

19:01.006 --> 19:02.496
Don't know.

19:02.574 --> 19:04.098
The name
on the marriage certificate

19:04.176 --> 19:07.202
is Arlene Machiavelli.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.110
That's a fake.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.876
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

19:10.949 --> 19:12.439
on account of the dress.

19:12.518 --> 19:15.282
You can tell she was pregnant.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.946
Man would have to be a mad dog

19:17.022 --> 19:20.924
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.518
Look at her.

19:26.865 --> 19:31.802
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.600
She's a little
blood-spattered angel.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.971
Son Number One?

19:40.045 --> 19:41.307
Yeah?

19:41.380 --> 19:45.908
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

22:20.806 --> 22:23.639
I might never have liked you.

22:24.776 --> 22:27.836
Point in fact, I despise you.

22:29.247 --> 22:33.445
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

22:36.588 --> 22:39.682
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

22:39.758 --> 22:43.023
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

22:43.095 --> 22:46.826
My gift to you.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.872
For fuck's sake.

22:58.443 --> 22:59.637
Hello, Bill.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.343
What's her condition?

23:03.415 --> 23:05.610
Comatose.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.909
Where is she?

23:07.986 --> 23:11.251
I'm standing over her right now.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.416
That's my girl.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.894
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.090
What?

23:20.165 --> 23:21.689
We owe her better than that.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.530
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

23:23.602 --> 23:25.263
Will you keep your voice down?

23:25.337 --> 23:27.202
You don't owe her shit!

23:27.272 --> 23:29.365
May I say one thing?

23:29.441 --> 23:31.272
Speak.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.374
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.380
But you didn't kill her.

23:36.448 --> 23:38.279
And I put a bullet in her head.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.683
But her heart
just kept on beating.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.186
Now, you saw that yourself

23:43.255 --> 23:48.158
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

23:49.094 --> 23:52.655
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

23:52.731 --> 23:58.192
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.204
But one thing we won't do

24:00.272 --> 24:04.641
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

24:04.709 --> 24:08.645
and kill her in her sleep.

24:08.713 --> 24:11.341
And the reason
we won't do that thing

24:11.416 --> 24:16.649
is because that thing
would lower us.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.746
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

24:20.725 --> 24:22.022
I guess.

24:22.093 --> 24:24.584
Do you really have to guess?

24:25.763 --> 24:26.654
No.

24:26.731 --> 24:30.667
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.201
Come on home, honey.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.565
Affirmative.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.005
I love you very much.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.240
I love you, too.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.575
Bye-bye.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.389
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

25:01.466 --> 25:02.956
Hmm?

25:04.536 --> 25:07.630
Word of advice, shithead.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.732
Don't you ever wake up.

25:45.710 --> 25:52.313
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.478
Bill, it's your baby.

26:57.515 --> 27:00.814
Oh, my baby.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.811
Four years.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.438
Four years.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.605
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.205
You getting your freak on
or what?

28:04.282 --> 28:06.409
Oh, yeah, boy.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.749
20, 40, 60, 75.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.792
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

28:15.859 --> 28:16.486
Rule number one.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.619
No punching her.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.459
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

28:19.531 --> 28:21.294
or less some teeth, jig's up.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.857
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

28:23.935 --> 28:25.698
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

28:25.770 --> 28:29.297
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.343
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

28:32.410 --> 28:35.641
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.410
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

28:38.483 --> 28:41.680
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.847
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.412
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.082
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.750
I'll be back in 20.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.655
Yeah.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.664
Oh, shit.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.292
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

28:56.367 --> 28:58.858
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

28:58.937 --> 29:02.338
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

29:03.341 --> 29:05.468
<i>Bon appetit</i>, good buddy.

29:14.519 --> 29:17.955
Oh, yeah.

29:19.457 --> 29:20.389
Oh, God damn.

29:20.458 --> 29:24.019
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.047
Oh.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.577
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.409
Coming in, ready or not.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.143
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

30:20.451 --> 30:21.975
Whoa.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.965
Aaaah!

30:51.683 --> 30:53.241
Where's Bill?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.945
Where's Bill?

30:57.222 --> 30:58.416
Please stop hitting me.

30:58.489 --> 30:59.615
Where's Bill?

31:01.292 --> 31:02.782
I don't know who Bill is!

31:02.861 --> 31:04.328
Bullshit!

31:12.237 --> 31:15.934
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

31:16.007 --> 31:19.340
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

31:19.410 --> 31:21.139
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

31:21.212 --> 31:25.512
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

31:28.586 --> 31:31.282
Your name is Buck.

31:31.356 --> 31:33.187
Right?

31:33.258 --> 31:36.352
And you came here to fuck.

31:36.427 --> 31:37.587
Right?

31:37.662 --> 31:39.254
Wait a minute.
Wait.

32:05.156 --> 32:07.147
"Pussy Wagon."

32:07.225 --> 32:09.159
You fucker.

32:36.321 --> 32:39.313
Texas. Okay.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.690
Wiggle your big toe.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.301
Wiggle your big toe.

34:42.346 --> 34:44.837
Wiggle your big toe.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.616
Wiggle your big toe.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.123
Wiggle your big toe.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.597
<i>As I lay in the back</i>
<i>of Buck's truck</i>,

35:01.666 --> 35:04.191
<i>trying to will my limbs</i>
<i>out of entropy</i>...

35:04.268 --> 35:05.895
Wiggle your big toe.

35:05.970 --> 35:10.031
...<i>I could see the faces of</i>
<i>the cunts who did this to me</i>.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.009
<i>And the dicks responsible</i>.

35:14.312 --> 35:20.114
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper</i>
<i>Assassination Squad</i>.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.714
<i>When fortune smiles</i>
<i>on something</i>

35:23.788 --> 35:26.256
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge</i>,

35:26.324 --> 35:30.317
<i>It seems proof like no other</i>
<i>that not only does God exist</i>,

35:30.394 --> 35:32.419
<i>you're doing his will</i>.

35:32.497 --> 35:35.091
<i>At a time when I knew the least</i>
<i>about my enemies</i>,

35:35.166 --> 35:37.157
<i>the first name</i>
<i>on my death list</i>,

35:37.235 --> 35:41.171
<i>O-Ren Ishii</i>,
<i>was the easiest to find</i>.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.673
<i>But when one</i>
<i>manages the difficult task</i>

35:43.741 --> 35:46.437
<i>of becoming queen</i>
<i>of the Tokyo underworld</i>,

35:46.511 --> 35:49.742
<i>one doesn't keep it a secret</i>,
<i>does one?</i>

36:02.860 --> 36:06.455
<i>O-Ren Ishii was born</i>
<i>on an American military base</i>

36:06.531 --> 36:08.897
<i>In Tokyo, Japan</i>.

36:08.966 --> 36:12.424
<i>The half-Japanese, half-Chinese</i>
<i>American Army brat</i>

36:12.503 --> 36:16.064
<i>made her flrst acquaintance</i>
<i>with death at the age of 9</i>.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.971
<i>It was at that age</i>
<i>she witnessed</i>

36:18.042 --> 36:19.839

Hyah!

37:32.883 --> 37:34.009
Hmm.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.419
Hmm.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.215
Oh.

39:40.978 --> 39:42.138
Mommy.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.250
<i>She swore revenge</i>.

40:54.318 --> 40:59.483
<i>Luckily for her</i>,
<i>Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile</i>.

41:01.392 --> 41:05.522
<i>At 11, she got her revenge</i>.

41:08.432 --> 41:12.198
Look at me, Matsumoto...

41:13.871 --> 41:16.965
...take a good look at my face.

41:18.909 --> 41:20.934
Look at my eyes.

41:23.948 --> 41:26.143
Look at my mouth.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.152
Do I look familiar?

41:31.455 --> 41:33.548
Do I look like somebody...

41:33.624 --> 41:35.785
you murdered?!

42:48.599 --> 42:53.536
<i>By 20, she was one of the top</i>
<i>female assassins in the world</i>.

43:41.085 --> 43:43.713
<i>At 25, she did her part</i>
<i>in the killing</i>

43:43.787 --> 43:48.952
<i>of nine innocent people</i>,
<i>including my unborn daughter</i>,

43:49.026 --> 43:53.360
<i>In a small weddlng chapel</i>
<i>in El Raso, Texas</i>.

43:53.430 --> 44:01.132
<i>But on that day four years ago</i>
<i>she made one big mistake</i>.

44:01.205 --> 44:03.730
<i>She should have killed 10</i>.

44:04.408 --> 44:08.811
<i>However, before satisfaction</i>
<i>would be mine</i>,

44:08.879 --> 44:10.904
<i>first things first</i>.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.916
Wiggle your big toe.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.258
Hard part's over.

44:23.327 --> 44:27.093
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

45:01.632 --> 45:03.725
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

45:03.801 --> 45:06.099
Okinawa.
One-way.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.595
Hi.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.565
Welcome...

45:41.271 --> 45:43.171
Welcome.

45:44.007 --> 45:45.975
You English?

45:46.043 --> 45:48.341
Almost.
American.

45:48.412 --> 45:52.178
American.
Welcome, American.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.546
<i>Domo</i>.

45:53.617 --> 45:56.450
My English very good.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.785
You said <i>"domo"</i>.
Can you speak Japanese?

45:59.857 --> 46:00.789
No, no.

46:00.858 --> 46:03.793
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.

46:03.861 --> 46:06.421
Um, may I sit at the bar?

46:06.497 --> 46:09.864
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

46:10.701 --> 46:12.896
Oh.

46:12.970 --> 46:15.803
What other words did you learn?

46:15.873 --> 46:17.966
Oh, just a minute.

46:18.041 --> 46:22.341
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.582
I'm watching my soap operas.

46:26.717 --> 46:28.708
Lazy bastard...

46:29.086 --> 46:31.145
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

46:31.221 --> 46:32.916
The tea's hot.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.719
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

46:34.792 --> 46:36.157
Shut up!

46:36.226 --> 46:39.161
Get your ass out here!

46:39.229 --> 46:41.197
Uh, excuse me.

46:43.267 --> 46:46.668
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

46:46.737 --> 46:47.669
Oh, let's see.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.865
Um, <i>"arigato"</i>.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.408
<i>"Arigato."</i>
Good!

46:52.476 --> 46:56.606
Um, I already said <i>"domo"</i>,
right?

46:56.680 --> 46:59.114
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:59.183 --> 47:00.241
"Konn-itch-iwa."

47:00.317 --> 47:02.046
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

47:02.119 --> 47:03.882
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

47:03.954 --> 47:05.615
<i>Konnichi wa</i>.
Please repeat.

47:05.689 --> 47:06.849
<i>Konnichi wa</i>.

47:06.924 --> 47:07.948
Perfect.

47:08.025 --> 47:10.050
Good, good, good.

47:10.127 --> 47:12.652
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

47:12.729 --> 47:14.219
Oh, you're making fun of me!

47:14.298 --> 47:17.290
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

47:17.367 --> 47:20.495
Pronunciation very good.

47:20.571 --> 47:25.167
You say <i>arigato</i>
like we say <i>arigato</i>.

47:27.878 --> 47:31.405
Well, thank you.
I mean, <i>arigato</i>.

47:31.481 --> 47:32.880
Mm-hmm.

47:32.950 --> 47:35.475
You should learn Japanese.

47:35.552 --> 47:37.486
Very easy.

47:37.554 --> 47:39.522
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

47:39.590 --> 47:41.751
Most difficult.

47:41.825 --> 47:44.726
But you have Japanese tongue.

47:47.064 --> 47:48.622
Okay, okay.

47:51.235 --> 47:55.569
Oh.
Oh, my God.

47:55.639 --> 48:01.475
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?
Hurry up... goddammit!

48:04.781 --> 48:09.514
Lazy oaf...

48:14.057 --> 48:16.116
What d'ya want?

48:16.526 --> 48:18.118
I beg your pardon?

48:18.195 --> 48:21.460
Uh, drink.

48:21.531 --> 48:22.793
Oh, yes.

48:22.866 --> 48:25.300
A bottle of warm sake, please.

48:25.369 --> 48:26.961
Warm sake?

48:27.037 --> 48:29.130
Very good!

48:29.206 --> 48:30.673
One warm sake!

48:30.741 --> 48:33.904
Sake? In the middle of the day?

48:34.378 --> 48:38.678
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

48:38.749 --> 48:41.650
How come I always have to get the sake?

48:41.718 --> 48:42.810
You listen well...

48:43.320 --> 48:46.619
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

48:46.690 --> 48:48.487
If this were the military,

48:48.558 --> 48:52.289
I'd be General by now.

48:52.362 --> 48:55.126
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

48:55.198 --> 48:59.100
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

48:59.169 --> 49:01.603
and you'd still get the sake -

49:01.672 --> 49:03.867
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

49:03.941 --> 49:04.999
Do you understand?

49:05.075 --> 49:07.009
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.

49:07.077 --> 49:09.045
Do you understand me?

49:12.349 --> 49:13.976
Sorry.

49:16.353 --> 49:19.220
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

49:19.289 --> 49:20.722
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.988
What brings you to Okinawa?

49:24.061 --> 49:25.858
I came to see a man.

49:25.929 --> 49:28.625
Oh, yeah.

49:28.699 --> 49:31.463
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

49:31.535 --> 49:33.127
Not quite.

49:33.203 --> 49:35.068
Not friend?

49:35.138 --> 49:36.537
I never met him.

49:36.606 --> 49:38.574
Never?

49:38.642 --> 49:40.405
Who is he?

49:40.477 --> 49:42.172
May I ask?

49:43.313 --> 49:46.077
Hattori Hanzo.

49:57.995 --> 50:00.759
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

50:02.099 --> 50:04.795
I need Japanese steel.

50:07.504 --> 50:09.972
Why do you need Japanese steel?

50:11.908 --> 50:14.468
I have vermin to kill.

50:17.848 --> 50:23.616
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

50:26.089 --> 50:28.080
Huge.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.872
May I?

51:57.948 --> 51:59.677
You may.

52:02.552 --> 52:04.042
Wait.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.646
Try the second one down.

52:59.609 --> 53:01.634
Funny.

53:01.711 --> 53:04.077
You like samurai swords.

53:06.883 --> 53:09.579
I like baseball.

53:17.527 --> 53:20.052
I wanted to show you these.

53:21.364 --> 53:22.126
However...

53:23.300 --> 53:26.565
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

53:27.304 --> 53:32.105
...I no longer make instruments of death.

53:33.476 --> 53:35.034
What I have here...

53:36.112 --> 53:41.607
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

53:43.053 --> 53:46.784
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

53:51.895 --> 53:55.160
...I have retired.

54:03.206 --> 54:05.299
Then give me one of these.

54:05.375 --> 54:07.707
These are not for sale.

54:09.145 --> 54:11.579
I didn't say "sell me."

54:11.648 --> 54:13.275
I said "give me."

54:15.552 --> 54:18.646
Why should I help you?

54:18.722 --> 54:23.921
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

54:26.229 --> 54:29.665
And considering the student,

54:29.733 --> 54:34.830
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

55:31.328 --> 55:33.023
You can sleep here.

55:33.997 --> 55:36.192
It will take me a month...

55:38.868 --> 55:40.267
...to make the sword.

55:41.671 --> 55:44.401
I suggest you spend it practicing.

57:12.829 --> 57:14.763
I've completed doing...

57:16.766 --> 57:20.429
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

57:22.772 --> 57:26.435
...to never do again.

57:29.145 --> 57:33.047
I have created "something that kills people".

57:34.784 --> 57:40.518
And in that purpose, I was a success.

57:43.626 --> 57:45.685
I've done this because philosophically,

57:46.496 --> 57:52.457
I am sympathetic to your aim.

57:55.205 --> 58:01.144
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

58:02.312 --> 58:05.770
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

58:05.849 --> 58:09.012
...God will be cut.

58:21.564 --> 58:23.828
Yellow-haired warrior...

58:24.100 --> 58:26.295
Go.

58:26.369 --> 58:27.927
<i>Domo</i>.

58:49.492 --> 58:53.258

Do you like Ferraris?

59:56.593 --> 59:58.584
Ferrari... Italian trash.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.633
Do you want to screw me?

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:14.866
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.279
Yes.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.713
How 'bout now, big boy?

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:24.902
Boss Tanaka!

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.709
What's the meaning of this outburst?

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.614
This is a time for celebration!

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.983
And what exactly are we celebrating?

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.889
The perversion of our illustrious council?

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:40.886
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.225
I will not tolerate this!

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:44.459
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:50.902
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.212
My father...

01:01:58.915 --> 01:01:59.973
...along with yours,

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:01.539
and along with yours,
started this council.

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.185
And while...

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:05.743
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:07.483
...they weep in the afterlife...

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:09.056
Shut up!

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.823
...over the perversion committed today!

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:15.120
Outrageous!

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.993
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.056
Bastard!

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.297
Fuck face!

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.467
Gentlemen.

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:31.105
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:36.675
By all means, allow him to express it.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:42.316
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.291
...which I love...

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:47.596
...more than my own children,

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:53.465
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.877
Aah! Aah!

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:20.558
So that you understand how serious I am...

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.825
...I'm going to say this in English.

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:23.864
Huh!

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:37.944
As your leader...

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.605
I encourage you
from time to time,

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:45.347
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:46.353
If you're unconvinced

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:48.856
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.119
tell me so.

01:03:50.193 --> 01:03:51.751
But allow me to convince you.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.955
And I promise you,
right here and now,

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.591
no subject will ever be taboo.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.932
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:05.130
The price you pay

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:08.109
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:12.136
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.615
Just like this fucker here.

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:19.580
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:24.388
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.053
I didn't think so.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.267
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.828
One ticket to Tokyo please.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.822
<i>Moshi moshi</i>.

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:49.921
Hey!

- Hey, yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.928
Gogo.

~ <i>Whoo-hoo whoo-hoo</i> ~

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:52.064
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.836
They demand ridiculous things.

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:56.173
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:57.075
What's gonna happen?

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:58.611
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.544
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:01.479
No, I don't want that.

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.014

Yes, it's me.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.336
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:16.481
Who do you remind me of?

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.217
Charlie Brown!

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:23.198
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.187
Charlie Brown.

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:25.956
Four pepperoni pizzas.

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:27.529
That's not on our menu...

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:29.931
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:33.800
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:37.308
O-Ren Ishii!

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:42.039
You and I have unfinished business!

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:13.631
Charlie Brown, beat it.

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:22.177
Miki.

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.469
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:18.490
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:21.434
Hi!

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.037
Gogo, right?

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.536
Bingo.

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.440
And you're Black Mamba.

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:34.540
Our reputations precede us.

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:37.215
Don't they?

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:44.254
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:47.988
But I beg you.

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.690
Walk away.

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.433
You call that begging?

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:07.304
You can beg better than that.

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:08.228
Aah!

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:14.833
Aah!

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:17.907
Aah!

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:22.970
Is that what I think it is?

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.774
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:33.183
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:35.918
Silly rabbit.

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:37.421
Trix are for...

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:38.584
Kids.

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.087
Hyaaaaaaah!

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:54.893
Hyah!

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.346
Aaaaaaaaahh!

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.628
Aaahh!

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:38.171
Aaaaahhh!

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:53.679
Aaah!

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:01.983
~ <i>I'm doin'</i> ~

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:04.047
~ <i>Ain't nobody doin' but me</i> ~

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:05.854
~ <i>Nobody but me</i> ~

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.895
~ <i>Yes, >I gonna philly</i>,
<i>I'm doin'</i> ~

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.226
~ <i>Ain't nobody doin' but me</i>,
<i>baby</i> ~

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:11.629
~ <i>Nobody but me</i> ~

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:14.759
~ <i>Well, let me tell you</i>
<i>nobody</i> ~

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:17.566
~ <i>Nobody but me</i> ~

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.539
~ <i>Well, let me tell you</i>
<i>nobody</i> ~

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:20.972
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:22.532
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:24.134
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:25.645
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:27.146
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.876
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.076
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.948
~ <i>Nobody</i> ~

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:12.081
This is what you get
for fucking around with <i>yakuzas</i>!

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:13.916
Go home to your mother!

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.778
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.114
...take them with you!

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:21.449
However...

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:26.783
...leave the limbs you've lost.

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:31.362
They belong to me now.

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:38.670
Except you, Sofie!

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:42.673
You stay right where you are.

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:38.521
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:44.864
Where was it made?

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:48.268
Okinawa.

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:53.045
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.216
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.581
YOU LIE!

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.417
Mm-hmm.

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.796
Swords however, never get tired.

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:17.593
I hope you've saved your energy.

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:22.469
If you haven't...

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:26.603
...you might not last five minutes.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:30.844
But as last looks go,

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:34.679
you could do worse.

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:17.175
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:22.454
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:28.621
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.493
Attack me...

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.354
...with everything you have.

01:35:58.619 --> 01:36:01.417
For ridiculing you earlier...

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:05.892
...I apologize.

01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:15.628
Accepted.

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.151
Ready?

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.419
Come on.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:21.534
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:29.162
Sofie.

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:31.728
Sofie.

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.630
My Sofie.

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:35.862
I'm so sorry.

01:39:39.206 --> 01:39:42.733
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:44.744
No more of that.

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.575
But still...

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:49.275
But still nothing.

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:54.083
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:57.555
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:01.158
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:04.331
The first reason is information.

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:07.201
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:08.964
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:14.503
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:18.671
And every time
you don't give me answers,

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:21.340
I'm gonna cut something off.

01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:27.952
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:29.486
Give me your other arm!

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:38.126
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

01:40:38.198 --> 01:40:39.358
If you had to guess...

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.365
What they've been doing.

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:41.628
Why she left you alive...

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:43.636
And where I can find them.

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.604
What would be your guess?

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:50.543
Guessing won't be necessary.

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.476
She informed me.

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:58.742
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:00.952
As I said before,

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:05.651
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:11.164
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:14.997
everything that happened
here tonight.

01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:18.334
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:22.000
by witnessing
your deformed body.

01:41:22.076 --> 01:41:26.342
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

01:41:26.413 --> 01:41:29.439
I want him to know what I know.

01:41:29.516 --> 01:41:33.247
I want him to know
I want him to know.

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:36.188
And I want them all to know

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:42.217
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:10.914
Revenge is never a straight line.

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.889
It's a forest.

01:42:17.197 --> 01:42:20.098
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:24.261
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:32.041
That woman deserves her revenge.

01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:41.286
And we deserve to die.

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:48.593
She must suffer
to her last breath.

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:04.310
How did you find me?

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:06.039
I'm the man.

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:13.653
One more thing, Sofie.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.816
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
