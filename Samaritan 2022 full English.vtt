00:11.137 --> 00:13.931
[dramatic music playing]

00:39.331 --> 00:40.624
[Sam] Many years ago,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.919
a battle of good
versus evil

00:44.003 --> 00:48.048
was waged between Samaritan
and Nemesis.

00:48.883 --> 00:52.470
Twin brothers who became
sworn enemies.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.723
But let me start at the
beginning.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.934
They were
freakishly strong.

01:00.019 --> 01:02.146
They unintentionally
hurt people.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.610
The residents
of the town

01:07.693 --> 01:09.278
grew to fear
the brothers.

01:11.781 --> 01:13.866
They waited
until the family slept,

01:13.949 --> 01:15.451
boarded up
their home,

01:15.534 --> 01:17.661
and set it on fire.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.122
The parents
were burned alive,

01:20.206 --> 01:23.542
but the twins
were unscathed.

01:23.626 --> 01:27.713
Samaritan grew to fight for justice,
to be a protector.

01:27.797 --> 01:30.049
[sirens wailing]

01:30.132 --> 01:33.344
Nemesis,
consumed by revenge,

01:33.427 --> 01:36.138
wanted the world to suffer
as his parents had.

01:37.765 --> 01:41.143
Samaritan tried to contain
his brother's fury,

01:41.227 --> 01:44.104
so Nemesis forged
a powerful weapon.

01:44.188 --> 01:48.651
A hammer that he poured
all his hate and rage into.

01:48.734 --> 01:52.112
It was the only thing
that could destroy Samaritan.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.242
Nemesis lured him to the
power plant,

01:58.494 --> 02:01.705
where he would defeat his brother
once and for all.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.875
[man] Joey!
What happened?

02:04.959 --> 02:06.126
Run, man! He's...

02:10.047 --> 02:11.340
[man 1] It's Nemesis!

02:15.761 --> 02:17.388
[man 2] Get the hell back!

02:18.389 --> 02:21.183
[Sam] Nemesis knew his brother would come
to save the innocent.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.103
[men exclaim]

02:24.812 --> 02:25.855
[gasps]

02:25.938 --> 02:28.023
[dramatic music playing]

02:35.447 --> 02:37.408
[Sam] The brothers
were equally matched.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.369
With the hammer,
Nemesis had the upper hand.

02:41.912 --> 02:42.997
But not for long.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.134
Samaritan and Nemesis
died in the blast.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.221
This is the story
we've all been told.

02:59.305 --> 03:02.224
But I believe
Samaritan is still alive.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.147
[sirens wailing]

03:12.234 --> 03:13.652
[reporter] In fairness
to our caller,

03:13.736 --> 03:14.987
if Samaritan
was in fact...

03:15.070 --> 03:16.697
-a type of guardian...
-[man on video] Which he is.

03:16.780 --> 03:17.781
...why fake his death?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.617
Samaritan abandoned us.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.869
-[reporter] Yes, but why?
-That's bullcrap.

03:21.952 --> 03:25.247
That answer is in my book,
Samaritan Lives.

03:25.331 --> 03:26.916
Sam?

03:26.999 --> 03:29.251
Sam, you got
any cash on you?

03:29.335 --> 03:31.003
Ma, come on.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.130
What happened to the five bucks
I lent you last week?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.299
I need it
for the bus.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.717
Please, I'm gonna be late.
I need it.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.720
[sighs]

03:42.932 --> 03:44.808
And, you know,
after taxes,

03:44.892 --> 03:48.187
it takes me about an hour
of bedpan cleaning just to earn that five.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.897
[chuckles]
Ma, just take it.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.858
Thank you. I love you.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.193
-I love you.
-Oh. And don't forget,

03:54.276 --> 03:55.611
take out the trash.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.904
It's raining.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.322
It's smelling.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.490
Lock this door.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.284
-Be good.
-[door closes]

04:02.368 --> 04:04.203
-[rain pattering]
-[siren wailing]

04:10.209 --> 04:11.335
[grunts]

04:26.350 --> 04:27.351
[door opening]

04:28.185 --> 04:29.687
-[thunder rumbling]
-[door creaking]

04:58.465 --> 04:59.508
[door closing]

05:25.826 --> 05:26.827
[man] Morning, Joe.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.550
[grunts]

05:45.471 --> 05:46.472
Yeah.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.808
Wait up, wait up.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.019
Anything good?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.355
Maybe.

05:55.773 --> 05:56.815
Get a puzzle.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.448
[baby crying]

06:06.241 --> 06:08.285
Come on!

06:09.828 --> 06:12.247
This again. [sighs]

06:15.793 --> 06:17.252
Damn it.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.594
[vehicle honking]

06:34.895 --> 06:35.896
[sirens approaching]

06:37.773 --> 06:39.441
[vehicle honking]

06:48.117 --> 06:49.952
[indistinct chatter]

06:57.709 --> 06:59.211
Hey.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.713
What is that thing?

07:02.548 --> 07:04.424
-Radio.
-That's cool.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.801
Does it work?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.387
Dead as a doornail.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.266
Why do you have
a broken radio?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.393
Why're you wearing
a broken watch?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.732
[Jace] Shorty!

07:20.816 --> 07:21.900
Hey, yo, Sam!

07:24.903 --> 07:26.321
Come on, squirt.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.241
Heard your door
got taped up.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.325
Think you might
wanna help me, now?

07:30.409 --> 07:32.870
Why would I wanna help you out?
You always call me squirt.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.163
What you want?
An apology?

07:34.246 --> 07:35.706
You wanna make
some money or not, little man?

07:36.331 --> 07:38.041
What'd I just say?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.169
-Shut up, Jace.
-You got it, squirt.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.300
Where you going?

07:46.383 --> 07:47.885
Come on,
stop being lame.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.219
You need the money,
don't you?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.639
[sighs]

07:52.723 --> 07:54.141
All right, then,
come on.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.315
-[grunts]
-[Jace] Whoa, man!

08:01.398 --> 08:03.233
Stop crying
and get up there, man.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.568
Ain't nobody
watching.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.114
[grunts]

08:09.198 --> 08:10.574
[Jace] Let's see,
let's see.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.201
It's time
to handle business.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.203
-I want you to start right there.
-What?

08:14.286 --> 08:16.580
You heard what I said?
Come on, man.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.123
-Come on. Start over there.
-Okay.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.583
Right at the bottom.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.918
That match
your height. [laughs]

08:22.127 --> 08:24.129
Bro, don't look at me like that, bro.
Come on.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.299
[grunts]

08:27.382 --> 08:28.884
Come on. Put your back
into it or something.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.511
Yeah.

08:31.595 --> 08:32.971
Come on. Pull it up,
pull it up, pull it up.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.056
Loving it,
loving it.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.016
-Yeah.
-[panting]

08:36.099 --> 08:37.768
That's a lot of money
right there.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.270
Come on, little man.
You can go faster than that.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.396
Come on, man.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.107
Whoo-hoo!
I feel like a birdie.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.444
-I'm flying like an eagle.
-[chuckles]

08:58.288 --> 09:00.791
Hey, man, you might want to downplay
this type of thing where we're going.

09:00.874 --> 09:01.875
[Sam] What do you mean?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.627
Man, Cyrus
loves Nemesis.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.837
Wanna be
just like him.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.215
We're going
to Cyrus' place?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.342
You didn't tell me
we were going to Cyrus' place.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.511
That guy
is out of his mind.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.392
[machinery whirring]

09:18.475 --> 09:19.685
[train horn blaring
in distance]

09:24.731 --> 09:26.400
[Pete] All right.
How much you want for it?

09:26.483 --> 09:28.193
[Jace] $400. Divide that by 10.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.569
40, 40.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.530
[Jace] Nah, man, put a one
in front of that 40.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.365
-Are you high?
-[Jace] Man.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.616
Throw it on the scale.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.244
The scale never lies.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.960
-40.
-Man, that don't even say 40.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.255
[man] You tripping, bro.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.675
[ominous music playing]

10:05.188 --> 10:06.523
[men shouting indistinctly]

10:09.943 --> 10:10.944
[man] Hey, boss.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.160
[Jace chuckles]

10:19.870 --> 10:20.871
[man] Yo!

10:20.954 --> 10:23.540
What's up, shithead?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.667
What you doing? Selling candy
for your basketball team? What's up?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.294
Nah, man,
I'm selling wire.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.296
Ah. You coming up.
How much they drag in, Pete?

10:29.379 --> 10:32.466
-Uh, $40.
-$40!

10:32.549 --> 10:33.800
Y'all wanna make
some real bread?

10:33.884 --> 10:35.969
There's a package store
on Castle Road.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.971
I need someone to make
a fool of themselves, cause a distraction.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.182
Hey, look, man,
I ain't doing nothing for you.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.767
Punk bitch.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.977
-My boy Jace big, but he a pussy.
-I'll do it.

10:44.853 --> 10:45.979
What?

10:46.063 --> 10:47.522
-[man 1] Nah, come on, man.
-[man 2] This lil' kid here.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.650
What? I can do this.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.153
-Nah, man, you tripping, bro.
-[man 1] Yo, this kid is crazy, man.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.237
I just distract
the guy?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.365
That's it. That's all
you gotta do.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.660
Yeah, I'm in.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.079
Come on.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.628
[man] You got a problem?

11:09.711 --> 11:11.254
[woman] No, there's no...

11:11.338 --> 11:13.507
What you looking at, old lady?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.384
[man 2] You got a problem
with my friend over there?

11:15.467 --> 11:16.510
[man 1] Yeah,
you got a problem?

11:18.637 --> 11:19.888
Come on, come on.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.556
All right.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.892
-You see him? Old guy?
-[Sam] Yeah.

11:23.975 --> 11:24.976
Stop looking. Stop looking.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.311
We're just taking
the lotto tickets, right?

11:26.395 --> 11:27.396
All right.

11:27.479 --> 11:28.730
He's not gonna shoot you
over that, probably.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.107
What do
you mean, shoot?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.316
You know what to do.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.401
-Wait. No.
-[Reza] Come on.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.568
[man1] Pow.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.913
[coughing] Help!
Help, please!

11:44.996 --> 11:46.832
Help! A car...

11:46.915 --> 11:48.250
I don't
need this shit.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.584
[panting, grunting]

11:49.668 --> 11:52.129
-[Sam] A car ran the light.
-[shopkeeper] What?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.213
[Sam] Help! Please!

11:53.296 --> 11:54.464
[Sam] Get the hell
out of here.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.549
This is none
of my business.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.509
[Sam] I need your help.
I can't get up.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.302
Come here.
What the hell is that?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.846
[sniffs] Hot sauce!

12:00.929 --> 12:02.472
-[Reza] Run, run!
-Goddamn thieves!

12:02.556 --> 12:04.182
-[man 2] Let's go.
-[Sam] Go, go, go!

12:04.266 --> 12:05.517
Goddamn
sons of bitches.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.603
[all laughing, cheering]

12:10.397 --> 12:12.149
-[man] Okay!
-[Sam] Let's go!

12:12.232 --> 12:14.025
[all laughing]

12:14.109 --> 12:15.735
-[man 1] Open the box, open the box.
-[man 2] Yeah. Yes.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.070
[Reza] There's some
serious value in there, cuz.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.656
-And we can do that shit anytime.
-Anytime, huh?

12:19.739 --> 12:20.907
What the hell's
wrong with you?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.118
[Reza] I told them to check
inside the boxes, cuz, I...

12:23.201 --> 12:25.537
-You didn't look inside the boxes?
-Hey, chips is good though.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.913
It was him.
Cuz, it was him, man.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.373
-He took the wrong boxes.
-That didn't happen.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.666
I did exactly
what you said.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.543
Are you calling me
a liar, bitch?

12:31.626 --> 12:34.421
-[Sam grunts]
-[all exclaiming]

12:34.504 --> 12:35.630
[Reza] Yeah, boy.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.715
[all laughing]

12:36.798 --> 12:38.508
[Cyrus] Are you
a liar, Reza?

12:38.592 --> 12:41.094
[laughter dies]

12:41.178 --> 12:42.220
Nah, Cyrus.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.279
How old are you, pal?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.324
Thirteen.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.659
Youngest
and the smallest, huh?

13:06.536 --> 13:07.871
Used to happen to me too.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.291
That gets old.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.793
Shit rolls downhill.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.757
That's what's
happening here?

13:24.346 --> 13:26.431
Should be grateful.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.475
The little man knows
when to keep his mouth shut.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.809
Cyrus, that's bullshit.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.144
Reza.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.737
He likes you.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.241
He likes people
that got bite.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.868
[chuckles]

13:48.787 --> 13:50.288
I was scared as shit.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.623
But you didn't rat.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.208
That means something.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.670
Yo! Come on.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.673
Shit.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.885
[Cyrus] Big fan, huh?

14:05.971 --> 14:06.972
Let me guess.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.059
You like him
'cause he was the good guy.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.146
Me...

14:19.192 --> 14:20.777
I got a different
perspective.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.155
Nemesis hurt people.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.074
Sometimes.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.619
But it's not always if you hurt,
but who you hurt.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.955
Nemesis always
punched up.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.707
I was about your age
when he died.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.542
He was my hero.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.043
Nemesis humbled the proud,

14:37.127 --> 14:39.588
gave people a beating
who needed a beating.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.216
To people around here,

14:44.050 --> 14:46.136
Nemesis was a god.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.430
Samaritan,

14:48.513 --> 14:51.391
just another cop
to protect the rich

14:51.474 --> 14:53.184
while the rest of us
went hungry.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.774
For what you did today.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.199
For what you'll do
for me in the future.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.452
[bell tolling]

15:16.916 --> 15:18.209
You do this
every month.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.129
And every month, I tell you
I get my check on the 5th.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.297
Like, why do you
do this?

15:22.380 --> 15:23.590
Why do you
embarrass me like this?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.008
-Mom...
-We got rules.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.343
-Has my check not been there before?
-Mom.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.427
-[man] Not on the first.
-Mom!

15:27.510 --> 15:28.511
-Mom.
-No.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.596
-Mom.
-No.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.680
You enjoy doing this.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.890
I'm not running
a shelter here.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.558
Take the damn money.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.519
Here.
Open the goddamn door!

15:37.228 --> 15:38.897
It's not personal.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.651
Same shit
every, every time.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.569
Can't open it
fast enough, huh?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.405
Come on.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.949
The nerve of this guy
locking me and my son out.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.953
As soon as I get enough money,
I'm gonna quit this job,

15:54.037 --> 15:56.247
we're gonna get on a bus,
and we're just gonna leave this city.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.833
You will never have to deal
with that creep's face again.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.210
-[water running]
-And go where?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.170
I haven't
figured that out yet.

16:02.253 --> 16:05.131
What's that
all over your face?

16:05.215 --> 16:07.467
I went to the store,
and I slipped,

16:07.550 --> 16:10.553
and I broke a shelf,
and I got sauce all over me and in my eye.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.222
And the guy at the counter
gave me some money

16:12.305 --> 16:14.057
so I wouldn't tell anybody
about it, okay?

16:17.227 --> 16:19.479
What have I
always told you?

16:19.562 --> 16:21.314
Sam? What have I
always told you?

16:22.565 --> 16:24.192
The decisions
you make add up.

16:24.818 --> 16:25.819
Exactly.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.198
Where did you
get that money from?

16:32.075 --> 16:33.493
Why didn't you ask me that
before you took it?

16:37.831 --> 16:41.501
[sighs] Even if I'm not very good
at the job, I'm still your mother.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.882
Ma.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.976
[Cyrus] Good.
They're here.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.315
The guy who led us to 'em said
they pack one hell of a punch.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.568
Where'd you get 'em?

17:06.651 --> 17:09.028
You know that army base
they're closing down outside of town?

17:09.112 --> 17:11.990
We planted one of our guys
to the burial ordnance.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.159
The things you bury
tend to haunt you.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.493
Like a ghost.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.039
-Oh!
-Boom!

17:20.123 --> 17:22.250
[man] When are we
gonna do this?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.710
[Cyrus] Tomorrow.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.882
[reporter on TV]
Tensions in the city continue to rise

17:28.965 --> 17:31.134
as the civil servants union
enters its second month

17:31.217 --> 17:33.511
of strikes due to drastic
budget cuts.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.723
Unemployment is on the rise
and homelessness is at an all-time high

17:36.806 --> 17:40.935
after an unprecedented spike
in evictions and foreclosures citywide.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.021
Many attribute
our current fiscal crisis...

17:45.940 --> 17:47.484
-[indistinct chatter]
-[sirens wailing]

17:57.911 --> 17:59.329
[Reza] Hey. Yo.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.666
Hey! You thought
I was kidding?

18:05.293 --> 18:07.003
I want the money
you cost me.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.087
[man] Get him!

18:19.224 --> 18:20.391
[woman] Hey!

18:20.475 --> 18:22.060

Get back here!

18:30.985 --> 18:32.821
[horns honking]

18:32.904 --> 18:34.322

Come on!

18:44.165 --> 18:45.166
[grunts]

18:49.337 --> 18:50.338
[Reza] Get him!

Come on! Get him!

18:52.173 --> 18:53.216

-[Sam groans]
-[Chris chuckles]

19:01.099 --> 19:02.934
Your mama's gonna
hear you scream.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.519
My mom's
at work.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.187
Oh, yeah? Well, she's gonna find you dead.

[Reza grunts, groans]

19:24.622 --> 19:25.874
Oh, my God.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.251
What's your problem, man?

19:28.334 --> 19:29.377
Come on.

Oh, my...

19:34.048 --> 19:36.259
Go on. Beat it.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.054
You need to make
some new friends, okay?

19:40.805 --> 19:42.599
Let's get out of here.

-[Omar] Let's go!

21:12.522 --> 21:13.523
[gasps]

21:25.118 --> 21:26.244
Oh, my God.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.079
[reporter] Nearly 17%
of the workforce

21:28.162 --> 21:30.498
has become
un or under employed.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.375
With the rise of autonomous manufacturing,

21:32.458 --> 21:35.545
that number
is set to explode.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.714
Now the machines are taking jobs...
[continues indistinctly]

21:49.600 --> 21:51.185
[sighs] Okay.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.567
"Smith, Joe."

21:57.650 --> 22:00.319
[reporter] And it's not
a matter of if, but when.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.612
And there needs to be a
safety net...

22:04.198 --> 22:05.408
Joe.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.549
Joe.

22:26.763 --> 22:30.099

Am I always
gonna have to look out for you?

22:57.585 --> 23:00.379

have to look out for you?"

[Cyrus] Officer.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.100
Evidence room's closed.
Come back some other time.

23:13.476 --> 23:14.977
Ever seen
one of these before?

23:16.896 --> 23:20.900
-[chuckles]
-Blackout bomb. Plays hell on electronics.

23:24.529 --> 23:25.947
[bomb beeping]

23:30.368 --> 23:31.994
Poof!

23:32.078 --> 23:33.496
[both laughing]

23:54.350 --> 23:55.560
Where's...

23:58.271 --> 23:59.272
What's that?

24:11.826 --> 24:13.327
Nemesis.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.294
It's here.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.337
I feel its power.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.022
With this, I can finish
what Nemesis started.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.607

25:16.015 --> 25:17.725
[Tuna] Yo!

25:17.808 --> 25:19.936
Wait, that thing is for real?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.646
[Farshad] Of course, it's real.
You think he's messing around?

25:21.729 --> 25:22.730
[laughs] Let's go!

25:32.198 --> 25:33.574
Oh, God.

25:33.658 --> 25:35.743
-I gotta talk to you.
-No, you don't.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.328
-I found him.
-No, you didn't.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.496
-Hi, kitty.
-[purring]

25:39.163 --> 25:41.082
Seriously.
I found him.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.917
Samaritan.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.335
Yeah, you told me
months ago.

25:44.418 --> 25:45.920
The custodian
at your school, right?

25:46.003 --> 25:47.296
No, not him.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.423
Turns out, he was just
really strong for a janitor.

25:49.507 --> 25:53.219
Or the mailman
who outran the bulldog, right?

25:53.302 --> 25:55.179
A breed known
for quickness.

25:55.263 --> 25:58.391
That dog was so fast,
you gotta see him run.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.351
Look, kid, I am
a serious journalist.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.769
An intellectual.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.022
I know. I respect
your work.

26:06.607 --> 26:07.900
Did you even
buy my book?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.529
Of course,
I bought your book.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.408
Okay.
I watch you online.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.952
-Yeah.
-No, but...

26:18.035 --> 26:21.205
I love your videos.
I watch them all the time.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.665
Come on.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.751
Look, kid, you can't just come in here
and harass me,

26:25.835 --> 26:27.628
and scare away
all my customers

26:27.712 --> 26:29.755
every time you see an old man
make a sudden movement.

26:29.839 --> 26:30.840
Get out.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.842
But this time is different,
I'm telling you.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.844
Look. I got ten bucks.

26:36.721 --> 26:39.765
I'll buy one of your books,
if you just hear me out.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.152
This is sweet.

26:53.779 --> 26:58.242
Twenty years of blood, sweat,
and tears on these walls.

26:59.327 --> 27:00.328
[pet food clatters]

27:01.078 --> 27:02.204
[Sam] Whoa.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.543
Hey, I actually...
I have something I wanna show you.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.631
Now, you can't
touch this.

27:13.799 --> 27:14.884
Do not touch.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.302
Just look.

27:18.429 --> 27:21.849
Ten years ago, I had a friend who was
a custodian at the police impound.

27:21.932 --> 27:23.225
He took this photo.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.604
That is a special
hand-forged hammer.

27:26.687 --> 27:27.688
It's a beauty.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.106
Do you know
where it was found?

27:29.190 --> 27:30.191
No.

27:30.274 --> 27:33.319
They found it
at the death site.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.363
Oh, wow.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.574
Bet that hammer was forged from the hatred
that Nemesis had for his brother.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.409
[searing]

27:43.371 --> 27:45.706
And that that hammer
is the only thing

27:45.790 --> 27:48.376
that could leave a scar
on either twin.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.294
Now my theory
is that Nemesis

27:50.378 --> 27:52.338
started the fire
in that power station

27:52.421 --> 27:55.966
because he wanted to throw
the whole city into anarchy and chaos.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.722
And, of course, he wanted to
lure his brother into a trap.

28:04.475 --> 28:05.684
But that plan
went haywire.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.482
Ultimately, it was his own hatred
that destroyed him.

28:11.565 --> 28:12.608
Man.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.902
Okay, let's get
to the main event.

28:14.985 --> 28:18.030
Who is your Samaritan
this time?

28:18.114 --> 28:20.408
He's a garbage man.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.368
He lives in the apartment
building across from me.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.452
[Casler] That's convenient.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.163
[Sam] Look, this time
is really different.

28:26.247 --> 28:29.333
He beat up these kids
that always bully me.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.001
He beats up children?

28:31.085 --> 28:34.171
No, no. Like, older kids.
Like, gang kids.

28:34.255 --> 28:36.465
He has this big,
nasty scar on his back.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.259
Exactly like
he was in a fire.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.886
And how did you
see this scar?

28:40.970 --> 28:43.556
I can see him
in his window.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.599
Okay, I don't know
what's more concerning here,

28:45.683 --> 28:47.435
that you think Samaritan
lives across from you,

28:47.518 --> 28:49.645
or that you're peeking
in the windows of old men.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.398
No, no, no.
It's not like that at all.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.900
Look, kid, you've said your piece,
that's ten dollars' worth.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.402
Okay, just wait
one second, okay?

28:56.485 --> 28:57.486
Let me
grab something.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.113
Let's go,
grab your stuff.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.614
Look.

29:00.948 --> 29:04.660
He did this.
Just by grabbing it.

29:05.661 --> 29:06.704
With his
bare hands?

29:06.787 --> 29:08.831
How cool is that?

29:11.459 --> 29:12.626
How do you know
the knife wasn't like this

29:12.710 --> 29:13.711
before the garbage man
grabbed it?

29:14.170 --> 29:15.921
I saw him do it.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.759
Oh, kid.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.761
You're gonna need more than
a horrifically scarred old man,

29:22.845 --> 29:23.929
and a bent knife, Tim.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.473
Sam.

29:25.556 --> 29:26.974
Close enough.
Grab your stuff.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.579
I see you
up there, a-hole.

Whoa.

[thunderclap]

31:04.113 --> 31:06.490
[people arguing indistinctly]

31:28.304 --> 31:29.305
What?

31:35.185 --> 31:37.062
"Samaritan
saves the day."

31:37.146 --> 31:38.564
Samaritan.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.858
[chuckles]

31:47.906 --> 31:52.786
[Farshad] You understand what it makes me
look like, when my cousin lies to Cyrus?

31:53.704 --> 31:54.705
It looks bad.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.708
I vouched for you.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.501
-Farshad, what do you want me to say?
-Nothing.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.961
Just stop talking.

32:01.587 --> 32:02.588
Yo.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.799
That's him.

32:05.883 --> 32:08.260
That's that old man.

32:08.344 --> 32:09.720
[Tuna chuckling]
That's the old man that beat you up?

32:09.803 --> 32:11.513
[Reza] Tuna, you go try him.
He'll beat your dumb ass, too.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.806
That's him.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.375
[indistinct conversation]

[Sam panting]

32:43.420 --> 32:44.588
Sam?

32:49.426 --> 32:51.637
Sam. Come here.

32:55.516 --> 32:56.850
[thunder rumbles]

33:04.483 --> 33:05.984
Sam!

33:06.068 --> 33:07.903
What, Ma?
What are you doing?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.488
[Tiffany] What do you mean,
"What?"

33:09.571 --> 33:11.115
I thought
we could have dinner.

33:11.907 --> 33:12.950
I...

33:13.033 --> 33:14.410
-What happened there?
-That?

33:14.493 --> 33:16.829
I ran into a locker.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.706
A locker? Does that locker
have a name?

33:18.789 --> 33:21.417
What? [chuckles] No.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.793
Just a locker.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.002
[banging on door]

33:29.341 --> 33:31.093
Yes?

33:31.176 --> 33:32.928
Your kid took
something valuable of mine.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.515
What?
Who are you?

33:36.598 --> 33:38.600
Joe Smith.
I live over there.

33:38.684 --> 33:39.935
What did he take?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.061
My scrapbook.

33:42.896 --> 33:45.274
Sam. Get over here.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.775
You have something
that belongs to this man?

33:53.615 --> 33:54.992
Let's have it.

33:55.909 --> 33:56.994
Apologize.

33:57.077 --> 33:58.996
I'm sorry.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.539
Is that all
you have to say?

34:00.622 --> 34:01.623
I don't know.

34:02.291 --> 34:03.584
I'm a fan?

34:05.169 --> 34:06.879
What is wrong
with you?

34:06.962 --> 34:08.756
What is that even
supposed to mean?

34:08.839 --> 34:09.923
Wait.

34:12.176 --> 34:13.427
Could I ask you
for a favor?

34:13.510 --> 34:15.262
He's a good kid.
He really is.

34:15.345 --> 34:17.139
So please,
don't call the police.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.767
He won't do this again,
I promise.

34:19.850 --> 34:22.603
[sighs] And this is not
an excuse.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.355
His father...

34:25.439 --> 34:26.732
Look,
he's changed.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.776
And you can blame me.
It's just...

34:28.859 --> 34:30.360
He's good.
He's just a little

34:31.153 --> 34:32.196
lost.

34:36.450 --> 34:37.576
No harm done.

34:40.162 --> 34:41.330
You have
a good mother.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.499
Lucky.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.895
[Sam grunts, groans]

35:04.978 --> 35:07.481
I've already checked out
that dumpster.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.149
Not much in it.

35:11.068 --> 35:13.570
You know, I wasn't gonna
keep the album.

35:13.654 --> 35:15.781
I just thought
you were him.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.742
That's all right. You know,
I used to steal some stuff, too.

35:18.826 --> 35:21.119
But who did you
think I was?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.165
Him?

35:25.249 --> 35:26.375
Yeah.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.876
Samaritan's dead.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.753
That's what they say.

35:29.837 --> 35:32.339
Yeah. I just pick up garbage
for a living. That's what I do.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.384
Don't punch me in my face
if I don't agree with you.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.012
I would never
punch you. What?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.682
Why do you have that scrapbook?

35:43.267 --> 35:45.477
Because I'm a fan. Like you.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.145
That's it.

35:47.229 --> 35:49.773
So, why don't you go play
football or whatever you do,

35:49.857 --> 35:53.151
because all this questioning is
just starting to get on my nerves now.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.612
Calling me this person
and calling me that.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.698
You mind your business, I'll
mind mine.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.074
You're a liar!

35:59.157 --> 36:00.450
I don't believe you!

36:00.534 --> 36:01.994
Listen, kid...

36:03.161 --> 36:04.162
Oh, we got him.

36:08.876 --> 36:09.877
Oh, he's out. He's out.

time.

I can't believe I found
Samaritan.

37:43.679 --> 37:44.930
Wrong.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.599
You're just a dude
who gets hit by a car,

37:47.683 --> 37:48.809
gets his bones broken,

37:48.892 --> 37:50.268
and eats mad ice cream.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.772
I eat this stuff
to cool my body down.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.524
Why don't you just drink some
ice water?

37:55.607 --> 37:57.359
I don't like the taste.

Sorry. I need it for
emergencies.

38:05.909 --> 38:08.078
Why were you steaming?

38:08.161 --> 38:11.707
You know anything about binary fission,
cellular thermodynamics?

38:11.790 --> 38:14.126
What? I'm 13 years old.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.461
You know what happens during a
heat stroke?

38:16.545 --> 38:18.839
When I get hurt, my body
overheats,

38:18.922 --> 38:20.924
and if I don't cool it down,

38:22.634 --> 38:23.802
my heart explodes.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.138
That is not human.

38:26.221 --> 38:29.391
Wait. Is this how it was for
Nemesis?

38:30.684 --> 38:32.394
You guys were brothers, right?

38:33.311 --> 38:35.897
Enough with the Nemesis stuff.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.441
Why don't you go have some ice
cream?

38:37.941 --> 38:39.026
Thanks.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.035
You saved my dad once.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.203
Where do you come up with this
stuff?

38:50.287 --> 38:52.330
Have you ever looked up
the word "delusional,"

38:52.414 --> 38:54.624
because that's what you are.
You're delusional.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.418
I'm not delusional.
I'm serious.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.003
You saved my dad.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.171
He used to boost cars.

39:00.213 --> 39:02.007
You caught him one night.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.676
And instead of busting him,
you talked to him.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.636
What'd he do,
write fairytales for a living?

39:06.720 --> 39:08.305
No, he died.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.563

people up.

for all the people this city
left behind.

42:26.670 --> 42:29.965
A mysterious blackout
and gang of men in Nemesis masks

42:30.048 --> 42:32.217
triggered a long night
of looting last night.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.927
Several people were injured.

42:34.010 --> 42:35.762
With the town on edge already

42:35.845 --> 42:38.139
with high unemployment
and poverty on the rise,

42:38.223 --> 42:41.977
some say it's only a matter of time
before the city implodes.

[Joe] Hey.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.167
[Sam gasps]

43:07.419 --> 43:08.920
What do I have to do?

43:09.004 --> 43:11.381
Throw you under a bus
to make you stop following me?

43:12.299 --> 43:13.675
Samaritan wouldn't do that.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.011
What if he was
having a bad day?

43:17.470 --> 43:18.471
Come on.

43:23.727 --> 43:24.936
So, what's in the bag?

43:25.020 --> 43:26.688
Hey, hey. It's a camera. Don't
touch.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.857
-Where you taking it to?
-To a pawn shop.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.317
Sounds horrible.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.238
What do you even do all day?

43:35.322 --> 43:36.614
Fix things
and get depressed?

43:36.698 --> 43:37.824
[chuckles]

43:41.036 --> 43:42.787
I'm a troglodyte.

43:42.871 --> 43:44.873
-Do you know what that is?
-No clue.

43:44.956 --> 43:48.501
It's Greek for a man who dwells
in a cave. See, I'm a caveman.

43:48.585 --> 43:51.004
I live in a tiny apartment, and
it's fine.

43:51.087 --> 43:53.673
I'm good with it. I like being
alone.

43:53.757 --> 43:56.426
You know what bothers me?
What really depresses me?

43:59.012 --> 44:00.263
Being around other people.

44:00.347 --> 44:01.765
Follow me?

No.

loner.

44:08.688 --> 44:10.607
Smells like bullshit to me.

44:13.526 --> 44:16.404
You got big balls.
I'll give you that.

44:16.488 --> 44:18.448
[Sam] So, how much do you think
you're gonna get off the camera?

44:18.531 --> 44:19.532
I don't know.

44:20.325 --> 44:21.493
10 bucks, 20 bucks?

44:21.576 --> 44:24.162
God, what are you,
an accountant or something?

44:24.245 --> 44:27.165
Do me a favor,
stay here while I go in there.

44:27.248 --> 44:28.249
Still want me to come in?

44:28.333 --> 44:30.710
No, yeah. That's why I said,
"Wait here."

44:30.794 --> 44:31.795
Hey!

44:33.713 --> 44:34.881
What are you looking at?

44:36.007 --> 44:37.050
[Joe growls]

44:40.762 --> 44:41.763
[sighs]

44:44.432 --> 44:45.725
Sorry.

44:48.937 --> 44:51.731
What? You just let that happen?

44:51.815 --> 44:53.900
Should've thrown him
over a tree or something.

44:56.986 --> 44:58.696
I'm disappointed.

45:02.909 --> 45:03.910
[Joe] Stay out.

45:06.955 --> 45:08.998
What the hell did you do?

45:09.082 --> 45:11.668
Just snapped off. It's falling
apart, like both of us.

45:11.751 --> 45:13.545
Yeah, well, speak for yourself.

45:16.256 --> 45:17.966
This is solid brass.

45:18.049 --> 45:20.468
I know. But even brass gets
tired.

45:20.552 --> 45:21.803
[Arthur] I'm taking this
out of your account.

45:21.886 --> 45:22.887
[Joe] That's fair enough.

45:22.971 --> 45:26.266
[Arthur] Another Sunday,
another piece of junk.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.685
-Give you $25.
-Whoa. Really?

45:28.768 --> 45:29.811
Here we go again.

45:29.894 --> 45:30.895
It's not a Canon.

45:30.979 --> 45:33.982
How about $50
and I take your picture with it?

45:34.065 --> 45:36.151
-[Arthur laughs]
-Okay.

45:41.698 --> 45:43.158
-Stop! Thief!
-[Joe] Look at this. See?

45:43.241 --> 45:45.452
This is what happens when you
let

45:45.535 --> 45:48.371
a couple of genetic freaks
try to fix your city.

45:48.455 --> 45:50.665
People gotta
get rid of their own problems,

45:50.748 --> 45:54.294
or their problems
gonna get rid of them, right?

45:54.377 --> 45:55.628
Right.

45:55.712 --> 45:57.422
How many bad guys did you fight
at once?

45:57.505 --> 45:58.840
100.

45:59.424 --> 46:00.425
Wow.

46:00.508 --> 46:02.719
How strong are you?

46:02.802 --> 46:04.846
I'm still pretty strong.
You saw that.

46:04.929 --> 46:07.390
But not like I once was.

46:07.474 --> 46:10.768
Things start to fall apart when
you stop caring, and I stopped caring

46:12.145 --> 46:13.813
a long time ago.

46:13.897 --> 46:15.315
[Sam] How far
can you jump?

46:15.398 --> 46:17.734
Then, maybe over 10 cars.

46:17.817 --> 46:19.402
Now, nine.

46:19.486 --> 46:21.446
No way. Let's see you do it.

46:21.529 --> 46:24.491
No, forget it. I'm not gonna
wreck my knees entertaining you.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.869
Have you ever had to jump off a
building?

46:27.952 --> 46:30.246
No, but I've thrown
a lot of people off 'em.

46:30.330 --> 46:31.748
I'm just kidding.

46:31.831 --> 46:33.708
Man, I've told you too much.

46:35.627 --> 46:37.337
You can trust me.

46:37.420 --> 46:38.671
You should know that.

46:53.645 --> 46:54.938
You ever get scared?

46:57.190 --> 46:58.733
Why? Are you scared of
something?

47:03.404 --> 47:06.449
-Just...
-Sure, I get scared.

47:06.533 --> 47:09.077
Come on. Everybody does.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.287
Fear, that's natural.

47:11.371 --> 47:13.581
But you'd still fight.

47:13.665 --> 47:15.250
Yeah, when necessary.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.794
But I don't want to. I don't
like it.

47:19.379 --> 47:22.882
When I get scared, the first
thing I think about is running.

47:22.966 --> 47:25.093
And I always freeze up.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.595
Hey. Come here.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.224
That's the smart thing to do.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.977
Street fighting is for fools.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.646
Why would you wanna get into a
fight with some stranger

47:36.729 --> 47:38.398
who has nothing to do with your
life,

47:39.399 --> 47:40.942
who could take your life?

47:43.903 --> 47:47.490
What you're doing is right,
okay?

47:50.618 --> 47:53.329
You better get going
before your mother calls the cops.

47:53.413 --> 47:55.707
All right. Good night, Joe.

47:56.624 --> 47:57.625
Sam.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.295
Let me see your watch.

48:15.852 --> 48:17.687
I'll try.

48:17.770 --> 48:18.813
But no promises.

48:20.315 --> 48:21.524
Thanks, Joe.

48:21.608 --> 48:22.984
You're welcome.

48:32.076 --> 48:33.494
[reporter on TV] For the second
consecutive week,

48:33.578 --> 48:35.913
rioters filled
the streets of Granite City.

48:35.997 --> 48:38.082
Another spontaneous blackout
followed,

48:38.166 --> 48:39.626
which some attribute
to a man

48:39.709 --> 48:43.504
claiming to be
the presumed dead villain, Nemesis.

48:43.588 --> 48:45.214
Under the cover of darkness,

48:45.298 --> 48:48.009
organized looters
vandalized financial institutions

48:48.092 --> 48:49.761
wearing Nemesis masks.

48:50.470 --> 48:52.096
Is Nemesis back?

48:52.180 --> 48:54.557
That is what the city
is asking this morning.

49:02.273 --> 49:03.566
Morning!

49:04.692 --> 49:06.361
What's so good about it?

49:06.444 --> 49:08.571
What's the matter? You sleep
okay?

49:08.655 --> 49:10.281
I got a migraine.

49:10.365 --> 49:12.492
You'll get 'em when you get
older. They're a nightmare.

49:12.575 --> 49:15.995
Well, funny you say that.

49:16.079 --> 49:18.831
I always have nightmares about
you getting hit by that car.

49:18.915 --> 49:22.335
-And since I saved you and all...
-Yeah, thank God for that.

49:22.418 --> 49:24.045
...I was wondering,

49:25.004 --> 49:27.799
if you could teach me how to
fight?

Meet me on the roof after work,
okay?

49:43.898 --> 49:45.775
Okay. Thanks.

49:45.858 --> 49:47.944
What a bad idea.

49:58.913 --> 50:01.290
[Sam] Hey. Sorry I'm late.

Wow.

50:22.270 --> 50:23.855
Where'd you learn to rip like
that?

50:23.938 --> 50:25.857
My father taught me when I was
four.

50:25.940 --> 50:27.316
I quit when he died.

-'Cause you're lucky.

lucky?

You're lucky
because you were raised right.

What if you don't got a choice?

50:54.510 --> 50:57.764

messes with your mom.

Well, then you sucker punch the
fool and run like hell.

everyone would get along.

comes easy.

Now, fixing them,
that helps me relax and focus,

things deserve a second chance.

what really happened.

57:22.064 --> 57:23.065
[cop] I'll get out.

You'll never hear from me again, I swear.
I won't tell a soul.

Some kids

1:01:02.368 --> 1:01:05.287

That means

-Who?
-The old guy!

1:01:11.543 --> 1:01:13.420
Not a chance. Do you see
that damn car?

1:01:13.504 --> 1:01:16.340
Cuz, I'm telling you, I saw the guy
walking around like nothing hit him.

1:01:16.423 --> 1:01:18.634
-Man, we hit him solid.
-Who?

1:01:18.717 --> 1:01:20.427
Some old man that was messing with Reza.

And you popped him?

1:01:22.221 --> 1:01:23.597

You're coming
with us.

1:02:45.554 --> 1:02:49.600
Well, my advice is
you should think long and hard

1:02:49.683 --> 1:02:53.812
before you make
a big, big mistake,

1:02:54.313 --> 1:02:55.314

1:04:10.764 --> 1:04:12.432
Did you just do that?

1:04:12.516 --> 1:04:14.226
You threw that bad man
through the wall.

1:04:14.309 --> 1:04:15.811
How'd you do that?

1:04:15.894 --> 1:04:17.479
Well, little girl,

1:04:18.564 --> 1:04:20.107
you didn't see anything.

1:04:20.190 --> 1:04:24.278
See, that hole was already there.
That's an optical illusion.

1:04:24.361 --> 1:04:27.239
-No, what I saw was you threw that man--
-No, no.

-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:05:01.607 --> 1:05:02.774
All right. I gotta go, kid.

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:04.401
Nice meeting you.

[reporter on TV]
Is there hope on the horizon?

1:05:14.745 --> 1:05:18.373
As Granite City grapples with
continued violence and mob uprisings

1:05:18.457 --> 1:05:20.500
caused by the return
of Nemesis,

1:05:20.584 --> 1:05:23.378
could this remarkable
footage, just in,

1:05:23.462 --> 1:05:25.631
mean that Samaritan
is back, too?

1:05:25.714 --> 1:05:26.840

1:05:33.180 --> 1:05:35.015
Now, this young girl saw
everything.

1:05:35.098 --> 1:05:36.308
Tell me, do you think
it was Samaritan?

1:05:36.391 --> 1:05:37.726
[girl on TV] My grandma
told me a story

1:05:37.809 --> 1:05:40.437
about how Samaritan
saved her from a speeding bus.

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.189
That man saved my life.

1:05:42.272 --> 1:05:43.774
And all he was missing
was a mask.

1:05:43.857 --> 1:05:45.233
-[knock on door]
-[reporter] Just incredible.

Yeah, I saw that.

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:54.868
Yeah.

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:56.662
You should
see the other guy.

1:05:56.745 --> 1:05:58.538
-What's with the bag?
-It's nothing.

1:05:58.622 --> 1:06:00.248
So what happened
to the other guy?

1:06:00.332 --> 1:06:01.375
Sucker punched him.

1:06:02.584 --> 1:06:03.877
But then,
I forgot to run.

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.754
Hey, I never wanted you
to get hurt.

1:06:05.837 --> 1:06:08.382
Well, I did.

1:06:08.465 --> 1:06:10.717
And now my mom won't believe a word I say.

1:06:10.801 --> 1:06:14.137
She won't listen to me when I tell her
something bad is going to happen.

1:06:14.221 --> 1:06:15.430
What's gonna happen?

Cyrus, the guy
from the junkyard.

1:06:18.934 --> 1:06:21.061
He's planning something
with the power stations.

1:06:21.144 --> 1:06:22.938
Call the cops
because I want no part of it.

1:06:23.021 --> 1:06:24.898
But you're the only one
that can help.

I can't
help anyone, Sam.

1:06:40.622 --> 1:06:42.499
So you run away?

1:06:42.582 --> 1:06:44.793
You're just as bad
as everybody else.

1:06:51.133 --> 1:06:52.134

Just incredible. Tell me,
how did that make you feel?

1:07:23.582 --> 1:07:27.586
[girl] Gosh. I guess,
I'm just happy that someone's looking out.

1:07:28.962 --> 1:07:31.047
Someone is,
indeed, looking out.

1:07:31.131 --> 1:07:33.925
And the question is catching on
in Granite City.

1:07:34.009 --> 1:07:35.844
Samaritan lives?

1:07:35.927 --> 1:07:37.220

1:07:37.304 --> 1:07:38.638
If he's Samaritan?

1:07:38.722 --> 1:07:40.682
C, it's him.
It's Samaritan.

1:07:40.766 --> 1:07:42.893
What happens if he comes
looking for Nemesis?

1:07:42.976 --> 1:07:45.854
What happens
if he tries to stop us?

1:07:45.937 --> 1:07:47.063
[Cyrus] I'm not
gonna let him.

1:07:47.147 --> 1:07:49.816
I'm gonna show him
who the real hero is.

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:52.444
After 25 years,
he comes back.

1:07:54.154 --> 1:07:55.155
[Cyrus yells]

1:08:07.876 --> 1:08:09.669
Where's the damn watch?
Where is it?

Oh, shit.

What do you want
from my son?

1:11:23.405 --> 1:11:24.614
Stay away
from my kid.

1:11:24.698 --> 1:11:26.533
Or you're gonna see a side of me
you don't wanna see.

1:11:27.993 --> 1:11:29.119
What do you want?

1:11:30.161 --> 1:11:32.330
-I just wanna talk to my pal.
-No.

1:11:32.414 --> 1:11:35.333

may have been Samaritan,

1:33:34.192 --> 1:33:35.861
carried a young boy
to safety.

1:33:35.944 --> 1:33:37.988
We're hearing some cheers right now.
It's the boy. Let's go.

1:33:38.071 --> 1:33:40.198
Shut up! Nemesis!

1:33:41.033 --> 1:33:42.367
Hey, kid.
What's your name?

1:33:42.451 --> 1:33:44.369
It's Sam.
His name is Sam.

1:33:44.911 --> 1:33:46.413
You were right, Sam.

1:33:46.496 --> 1:33:49.624
Well, Sam, can you answer the question
that everyone has been asking?

1:33:49.708 --> 1:33:51.418
Yes, Samaritan lives.

1:33:51.501 --> 1:33:53.211
You're certain
that it's really him?

1:33:54.046 --> 1:33:57.090
Man, it was hot in there.
Fire all around.

1:33:57.174 --> 1:34:00.510
Samaritan came right through
the flames and helped me.

1:34:00.594 --> 1:34:03.347
That was Samaritan!
He saved my life.

1:34:03.430 --> 1:34:05.599
[people cheering]

1:34:05.682 --> 1:34:09.394
[crowd chanting]
Samaritan! Samaritan! Samaritan!
