WEBVTT

04:13.628 --> 04:15.164
- Morning, Scott.
- Morning, Vince.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.399
- Morning, Wells.
- Morning, sir.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.754
Hi.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.463
Ghost rider, this is strike.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.211
We have unknown aircraft.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.671
Inbound, mustang.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.098
Your vector, 090 for bogey.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.521
Who's up there?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.979
Cougar and Merlin
and Maverick and goose.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.449
Great.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.486
Maverick and goose.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.035
Talk to me, goose.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.045
Roger, I got him.
Contact, 20 left at 30 miles.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.338
Nine-hundred knots closure.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.876
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.133
- Merlin, you got him?
- Roger, I've got radar contact.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.632
I'll get a visual ID.
Cougar, you hook him.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.591
Roger, and I'll clean him and fry him.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.736
Mustang.
Mustang, this is ghost rider, 203.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.194
I've got him inbound,
bogey heading 270.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.991
We're at ten miles, 900 knots closure.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.238
Ghost rider, take angels ten left, 30.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.893
Are we supposed to have visitors today?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.202
Negative, sir.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.917
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.217
- Goose, you see a trailer?
- Negative, Merlin.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.724
Looks like he's a single.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.783
Cougar, I'm gonna go
head-to-head with him.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.225
Take it easy, Maverick.
I don't like this shit.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.144
I'm gonna break high and right,
see if he's really alone.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.785
We've got 1,000 knots closure, mav.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.246
He's coming right at us.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.456
Okay, buddy, what's on your mind?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.384
Holy shit, there's two of them.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.759
Mig-28s.
No one's been this close before.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.466
What the hell are they doing here?
What's the position?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.289
Two hundred and fifty miles out, sir.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.349
Two hundred and fifty miles?
Get them out of here.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.100
Cougar, you've got mig one.
I'm going after mig two.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.569
I lost him in the sun.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.648
Shit. What's he doing?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.608
You got him, Merlin?

06:53.163 --> 06:55.779
He's coming around.
He's coming around on our tail.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.832
God damn it. This bogey's all over me.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.045
What's their range now?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.747
Two hundred miles, sir.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.207
If they break 150 miles,

07:07.302 --> 07:09.463
- launch the alert five aircraft.
- Yes, sir.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.259
Air speed, 300. Go get him, mav.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.382
I'm going for missile lock.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.476
Let's see if we can scare
this guy out of here.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.679
Come on, lock up, baby.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.187
Lock up, baby. Lock up.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.484
I got him locked. Bingo.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.234
We got him, mav.
He's bugging out and going home.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.987
Mustang, this is Maverick.
Mig two is headed home.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.945
All right, what's their position?

07:40.001 --> 07:42.663
A hundred and eighty miles
at bearing 010, sir.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.878
Cougar, he's got missile lock on us.
Get away from this guy.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.880
What the hell is this shit?
He's engaging me.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.346
God damn it, mustang.
This is ghost rider,

07:55.433 --> 07:57.344
one, one, seven,
this bogey's all over me.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.538
He's got missile lock on me.
Do I have permission to fire?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.723
Do not fire until fired upon.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.795
Goose, there they are, right below us.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.231
The mig's in perfect firing position.
He's right on cougar's tail.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.822
No way, goose. He'd have fired by now.
He's just trying to piss us off.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.484
Maverick, get down here
and get this asshole off me.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.162
Easy, cougar.

08:20.083 --> 08:25.453
Bring it back, hard right.
Help me engage. I'm on my way.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.517
I can't shoot this son of a bitch.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.447
Let's see if we can have
a little fun with him.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.654
Is this your idea of fun, mav?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.152
Greetings.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.868
Watch the birdie.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.326
Jeez, I crack myself up.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.799
This is a great shot, mav.
I should be a photographer.

09:17.849 --> 09:18.884
Cougar,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.053
your tail is clear. Mig one's bugged out.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.353
Cougar, this is Maverick.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.148
We've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.304
I'm getting a little low on fuel,

09:38.328 --> 09:39.488
so we're heading home.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.201
We'll see you on deck.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.551
Cougar, we're running low on gas,
we gotta get out of here.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.255
Cougar.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.217
We're on vapor, cougar.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.136
Let's do it.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.932
Cougar. Come on, cougar.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.068
Let's take it back to the ship, man.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.119
Come on, cougar.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.993
Get him on deck as soon as possible.
He's gotta be low on fuel.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.249
Cougar, we gotta land this thing.
We are way low on gas.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.749
You understand me?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.290
You all right, man?

10:41.766 --> 10:44.758
Maverick, you're at three-quarters
of a mile, call the ball.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.142
Roger. Maverick has the ball.

10:48.690 --> 10:52.023
- Cougar, it is time to land. Let's do it.
- Goose, cougar's in trouble.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.143
Come on, mav,
we're getting low on gas.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.689
Let's land this sucker.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.696
Cougar!

11:05.540 --> 11:06.871
God damn it, Maverick.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.082
What're you doing, mav?
We've got no fuel for this.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.659
We're going after cougar.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.997
You tell him to land that plane.
That's an order.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.624
Ghost rider, you are instructed to land.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.175
Land immediately.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.675
Any of you boys seen
an aircraft carrier around here?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.761
Mav, we got a little problem up here.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.098
That mig really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.399
You're okay, cougar.
Just stay on my wing,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.235
I'll take you all the way in.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.865
Just stay with me.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.550
Easy, cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.089
You're a little low.
You're a little low, coug.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.095
Come on, buddy, pull up.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.306
Pull up, cougar.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.061
That's it. Almost there.

12:16.444 --> 12:20.483
Cougar, you're well below glide path,
three-quarters of a mile. Call the ball.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.280
Roger, ball.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.788
We're too low, cougar.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.331
We're too low, cougar.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.210
Increase power. Some more power!

12:39.300 --> 12:41.336
Higher! Higher! Higher, damn it!

12:51.688 --> 12:52.928
Come in.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.768
Sir.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.730
Cougar, you should be in sickbay.
What's on your mind?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.736
My wife and kid, sir.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.027
I almost orphaned him today,
and I've never even seen him.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.449
I don't know what happened
up there, but I was so scared.

13:10.581 --> 13:14.199
- Come on, we've seen this before.
- No, sir.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.202
I'm holding on too tight.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.086
I've lost the edge.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.376
I'm sorry, sir.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.634
I'm sorry.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.475
Cougar.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.892
Thanks, Maverick.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.396
Maverick, goose, come in here.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.562
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.902
Shit.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.989
Maverick, you just did
an incredibly brave thing.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.082
What you should have done
was land your plane.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.664
You don't own that plane,
the taxpayers do.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.959
Son, your ego is writing checks
your body can't cash.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.502
You've been busted.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.839
You lost your qualifications
as section leader three times.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.258
Put in hack twice by me.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.594
With a history of high-speed passes

14:15.688 --> 14:18.020
over five air-control towers

14:18.149 --> 14:19.855
and one admiral's daughter.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.478
Penny Benjamin?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.484
And you, asshole.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.444
You're lucky to be here.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.862
Thank you, sir.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.344
And let's not bullshit, Maverick,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.825
your family name ain't
the best in the Navy.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.870
You need to be doing it better
and cleaner than the other guy.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.116
Now, what is it with you?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.875
Just wanna serve my country,
be the best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir!

14:39.003 --> 14:40.539
Don't screw around with me, Maverick.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.703
You're a hell of an instinctive pilot.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.125
Maybe too good.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.040
I'd like to bust your butt, but I can't.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.963
I got another problem here.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.721
I gotta send somebody
from this squadron to miramar.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.682
I gotta do something here.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.682
I still can't believe it.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.802
I gotta give you your dream shot.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.808
I'm gonna send you up against the best.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.685
You two characters

15:02.402 --> 15:03.812
are going to top gun.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.855
For five weeks, you're gonna fly against
the best fighter pilots in the world.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.407
You were number two,
cougar was number one.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.325
Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.828
You guys are number one.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.073
But you remember one thing.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.583
You screw up just this much,

15:22.213 --> 15:25.922
you'll be flying a cargo plane
full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.255
Yes, sir!

15:31.347 --> 15:32.507
That is all.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.598
You can tell me about
the mig some other time.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.765
Gentlemen.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.850
Good luck, gentlemen.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.599
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.602
During Korea,
the Navy kill ratio was 12-to-1.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.400
We shot down 12 of their jets
for every one of ours.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.229
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-to-1.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.235
Our pilots become dependent
upon missiles.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.738
They had lost some
of their dogfighting skills.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.406
Now top gun was created
to teach a.C.M.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.908
Air combat maneuvering.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.913
Dogfighting.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.582
This gives me a hard-on.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.581
By the end of Vietnam,
that ratio was back up to 12-to-1.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.672
Don't tease me.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.004
Blinds, please.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.986
Now I'd like to take this opportunity

16:51.010 --> 16:53.342
to introduce you to
our commanding officer at top gun.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.837
The very first man
to win the top gun trophy.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.007
You will not find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere in the world.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.514
Commander Mike metcalf.
Callsign, viper.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.762
Gentlemen.

17:05.608 --> 17:09.942
You are the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.194
The elite.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.696
The best of the best.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.699
We'll make you better.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.945
You'll fly at least
two combat missions a day,

17:21.040 --> 17:22.450
attend classes in between

17:22.541 --> 17:24.373
and evaluations of your performance.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.454
Now, on each combat sequence,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.537
you're gonna meet a different challenge.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.456
Every encounter is gonna be
much more difficult.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.529
We're gonna teach you to fly the f-14

17:33.553 --> 17:34.696
right to the edge of the envelope,

17:34.720 --> 17:36.381
faster than you've ever flown before

17:37.056 --> 17:38.512
and more dangerous.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.966
Now, we don't make
policy here, gentlemen.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.887
Elected officials, civilians do that.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.389
We are the instruments of that policy.

17:49.235 --> 17:53.569
And although we're not at war, we must
always act as though we are at war.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.733
What are you doing?

17:54.865 --> 17:56.718
- The tip of the spear...
- I'm just wondering...

17:56.742 --> 17:57.742
Best be sharp.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.074
Who's the best.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.910
In case some of you wonder
who the best is,

18:01.998 --> 18:04.159
they're up here
on this plaque on the wall.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.413
The best driver and his rio
from each class has his name on it.

18:09.839 --> 18:13.252
And they have the option to come
back here to be top gun instructors.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.336
You think your name's
gonna be on that plaque?

18:20.182 --> 18:21.217
Yes, sir.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.926
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.517
Yes, sir.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.607
I like that in a pilot.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.363
Just remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.202
Gentlemen, this school
is about combat.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.080
There are no points for second place.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.707
Dismissed.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.954
Nice going.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.628
The plaque for the alternates is
down in the ladies' room.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.134
Oh, Jesus. Oh, you kill me.
You really do.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.310
No, no, no, no.
There's two o's in "goose," boys.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.904
Hi.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.111
This is what I call
a target-rich environment.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.659
You live your life
between your legs, mav.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.496
Goose, even you could get laid
in a place like this.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.003
I'm telling you, I'd be happy to
find a girl who'd talk dirty to me.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.171
Mav,

19:40.262 --> 19:41.843
you want to know who the best is?

19:42.431 --> 19:43.841
That's him. Iceman.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.925
That's the way he flies,
ice-cold, no mistakes.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.603
Just wears you down.
You get bored, frustrated,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.646
do something stupid, and he's got you.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.774
Hey, hey, slider.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.734
Thought you wanted to be a pilot, man.
What happened?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.195
Goose, you're such a dickhead.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.677
Whose butt did you kiss to get in here?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.783
Well, the list is long but distinguished.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.450
Yeah, well, so is my Johnson.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.613
- So you're flying with iceman?
- It's Mr. iceman to you.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.290
- Hey, mother goose. How's it going?
- Good, Tom.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.039
This is Pete Mitchell. Tom kazansky.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.663
- Congratulations on top gun.
- Thank you.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.126
Sorry to hear about cougar.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.977
He and I were like brothers
in flight school.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.384
- He was a good man.
- Still is a good man.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.836
Yeah, that's what I meant.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.386
- Thought so.
- Say, you need any help?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.179
With what?

20:30.563 --> 20:31.894
You figured it out yet?

20:33.315 --> 20:34.475
What's that?

20:35.568 --> 20:36.728
Who's the best pilot.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.560
No, I think I can figure
that one out on my own.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.980
I heard that about you.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.234
You like to work alone.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.486
Mav, you must've soloed
under a lucky star?

20:48.664 --> 20:51.264
I mean, first the mig, and then you guys
slide into cougar's spot.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.824
We didn't slide into cougar's spot.
It was ours, okay?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.879
Yeah, well, some pilots wait their
whole career just to see a mig up close.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.087
Guess you guys are lucky and famous?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.672
No, you mean notorious.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.761
I'll see you later.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.756
You can count on it.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.672
They were abused children.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.927
- We're gonna have a good time.
- Always.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.016
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.601
All right, the bet is $20.

21:20.738 --> 21:21.944
$20. _right.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.778
You have to have carnal knowledge,

21:23.908 --> 21:25.444
of a lady this time

21:26.118 --> 21:28.200
- on the premises.
- On the premises.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.204
Come on, mav. A bet's a bet.

21:32.917 --> 21:36.034
I don't know, it just...
It just doesn't seem fair.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.208
For you, I mean.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.459
But...

21:39.423 --> 21:41.254
She's lost that loving feeling.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.467
She's lost...

21:42.593 --> 21:43.878
- No, she hasn't.
- Yes, she has.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.781
- She has not lost that...
- Goose, she's lost it.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.885
Mav. Come on.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.260
I hate it when she does that. Shit.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.721
- Excuse me, miss.
- Hey, hey, hey.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.523
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.

22:00.319 --> 22:04.358
You never close your eyes anymore

22:04.490 --> 22:07.323
when I kiss your lips

22:08.369 --> 22:11.486
there's no tenderness like before

22:11.622 --> 22:15.035
in your fingertips

22:15.501 --> 22:18.459
you're trying hard not to show it

22:18.546 --> 22:20.628
baby

22:20.714 --> 22:22.670
but, baby

22:22.800 --> 22:26.338
believe me I know it

22:26.470 --> 22:30.679
you've lost that loving feeling

22:31.183 --> 22:35.142
whoa, that loving feeling

22:35.229 --> 22:38.312
you've lost that loving feeling

22:38.399 --> 22:42.187
now it's gone, gone, gone

22:42.486 --> 22:44.602
whoa, whoa, whoa

22:44.697 --> 22:49.316
ba-doom, ba-doom
ba-doom boom boom ba-doom

22:49.577 --> 22:50.657
sit down.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.888
Ba-doom ba-doom boom boom
ba-doom, ba-doom...

22:51.912 --> 22:53.243
Thank you.

22:53.831 --> 22:54.946
Baby, baby

22:55.040 --> 22:58.828
I get down on my knees for you

22:58.919 --> 23:00.705
ba-doom, ba-doom
ba-doom boom boom

23:00.838 --> 23:02.578
I love that song.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.205
I've never seen that approach.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.751
If you would only love me...

23:05.885 --> 23:07.525
How long have you two
been doing this act?

23:07.595 --> 23:09.381
Oh, I don't know, since...

23:09.555 --> 23:11.716
- Puberty?
- Right, puberty.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.052
- I'm Charlotte blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.516
Maverick?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.394
Did your mother not like you
or something?

23:19.523 --> 23:21.184
No, it's my callsign.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.601
- You're a pilot.
- That's right, a naval aviator.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.314
Oh.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.147
No, actually, we've only done this, twice.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.731
Oh, how'd you do?

23:32.077 --> 23:34.443
Crashed and burnt on the first one.
It wasn't pretty.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.997
- And second?
- I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.948
But it's looking good so far.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.120
Well, uh, Maverick,

23:45.633 --> 23:48.750
my friend's just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.209
- Perry.
- Hi.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.464
Hi. Here you go.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.963
Oh, I'll be with you
in just a second, okay?

23:56.143 --> 23:59.635
Listen, can I ask you
a personal question?

24:00.314 --> 24:01.554
That depends.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.941
Are you a good pilot?

24:07.071 --> 24:08.436
I can hold my own.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.114
Great.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.733
Then I won't have to worry about you
making your living as a singer.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.627
I'm gonna need a beer
to put these flames out. Yo!

24:25.673 --> 24:27.959
Great, mav. Real slick.

24:52.366 --> 24:55.824
- It was a long cruise, was it, sailor?
- It was too long.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.904
What did you wanna do, just drop
right down on the tile and go for it?

25:00.708 --> 25:02.824
No, I actually had...

25:02.918 --> 25:04.658
Had this counter in mind.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.037
Great, that would be
very, very comfortable. Yeah.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.379
It could be.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.048
Actually, I came in here
to save you from

25:15.848 --> 25:18.590
making a big mistake
with that older guy.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.351
Really?

25:21.395 --> 25:25.104
So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

25:27.693 --> 25:28.693
Maybe.

25:29.695 --> 25:30.730
No?

25:30.863 --> 25:32.979
I've gotta be at work
very early in the morning.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.358
Then what are you doing here?

25:36.201 --> 25:37.862
Your friend was magnificent.

25:43.584 --> 25:44.915
Nah.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.704
Now, you'll also be trained and
evaluated by a few civilian specialists.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.570
The civilians are here because
they are our very best source

25:53.594 --> 25:55.300
of information on enemy aircraft.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.257
One of the most qualified
is our tagrep,

25:58.390 --> 25:59.755
callsign, Charlie.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.008
She has a ph.D. In astrophysics,

26:02.102 --> 26:03.763
and she's also a civilian contractor,

26:03.896 --> 26:05.511
so you do not salute her.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.766
But you better listen to her,

26:06.815 --> 26:09.147
because the Pentagon listens to her
about your proficiency.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.229
- It's all yours, Charlie.
- Thank you.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.273
Hello.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.569
We will be dealing with f-5s and a-4s

26:17.659 --> 26:19.149
as our mig simulators.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.444
Now, then, as most of you know,

26:21.747 --> 26:24.363
the f-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio

26:24.458 --> 26:25.948
that the mig-28 has.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.959
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots,

26:29.088 --> 26:30.419
like the mi(Gg-28.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.624
However,

26:32.091 --> 26:36.130
the mig-28 does have a problem
with its inverted flight tanks.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.302
It won't do a negative-g pushover.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.076
- The latest intelligence...
- Are you gonna tell her?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.911
- Tells us that the most it will do...
- Nothing.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.641
Is one negative...

26:45.646 --> 26:47.261
Excuse me, lieutenant.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.438
Is there something wrong?

26:49.525 --> 26:52.141
Yes, ma'am, the data
on the mig is inaccurate.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.144
How's that, lieutenant?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.896
Well, I just happened to see
a mig-28 do...

26:57.991 --> 26:59.322
We, we.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.657
Sorry, goose.

27:00.786 --> 27:04.950
We happened to see a mig-28
do a four-g negative dive.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.872
Where did you see this?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.162
That's classified.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.452
It's what?

27:12.005 --> 27:13.370
It's classified.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.762
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.804
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.509
Well, ma'am, it doesn't seem so
in this case, now, does it?

27:27.354 --> 27:28.719
So, lieutenant,

27:29.481 --> 27:31.392
where exactly were you?

27:32.818 --> 27:34.649
- Well, we...
- Thank you.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.800
And then I moved in above him.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.735
Well, if you were directly above him,

27:40.826 --> 27:42.407
how could you see him?

27:43.162 --> 27:44.368
Because I was inverted.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.656
Bullshit.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.157
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.866
He was inverted.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.418
You were in a four-g

27:53.881 --> 27:56.372
inverted dive with a mi(G-287?

27:56.717 --> 27:59.504
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

27:59.595 --> 28:01.551
No. About two meters.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.545
It was actually about
one and a half, I think.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.535
It was one and a half.
I've got a great polaroid of it.

28:05.559 --> 28:06.870
He's right there.
It must be one and a half.

28:06.894 --> 28:07.929
It was a nice picture.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.055
Lieutenant.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.268
Thanks, I like my pictures.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.730
What were you doing there?

28:14.735 --> 28:16.942
- Communicating.
- Communicating.

28:17.404 --> 28:20.066
Keeping up foreign relations. I was,

28:20.532 --> 28:22.363
you know, giving him the bird.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.694
- You know, the finger.
- Yes, I know the finger, goose.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.238
I'm sorry, I hate it when it does that.
I'm sorry.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.699
Excuse me.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.251
So you're the one.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.412
Yes, ma'am.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.874
All right, gentlemen,
we have a hop to take.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.501
The hard deck on this hop
will be 10,000 feet.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.427
There'll be no engagement below that.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.550
Move it!

28:48.268 --> 28:49.804
Disappear like that.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.765
Lieutenant.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.481
Okay, well, don't be late again.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.170
- You look great, honey.
- Thanks, dear.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.605
See you in preflight.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.069
Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me

29:02.157 --> 29:04.113
that you were a famous mig insulter?

29:04.576 --> 29:07.784
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room, no.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.778
And what would've?

29:10.332 --> 29:11.947
I'm an instructor at this school.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.541
I see 20 new hotshots
every eight weeks.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.619
Now, I'm sure you can figure that out.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.628
Look, lieutenant.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.587
I'd just really like to hear
about the mig sometime.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.593
You've got security clearance.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.092
You can read about it.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.978
Maverick.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.148
I'm curious.

29:39.319 --> 29:42.482
Who was covering cougar

29:42.614 --> 29:44.980
while you were showboating
with this mig?

29:45.826 --> 29:47.657
Cougar was doing just fine.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.658
Gentlemen, this is your first hop.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.075
The jets you are flying against

29:53.166 --> 29:55.532
are smaller, faster
and more maneuverable,

29:55.627 --> 29:56.833
just like the enemy migs.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.795
The clock is ticking,
and as of now, we are keeping score.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.164
I lost him, goose.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.800
Show me what you got, kid.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.134
- I lost him.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.683
I got him, I got him.
He's on our tail, coming hard.

30:13.729 --> 30:16.186
Yeah, I got him. I got him. Here we go.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.489
- All right, talk to me, goose.
- He's still back there.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.320
He's closing in on us. He's closing fast.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.243
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.472
Come on, Jester. Let's see if I can
give you a run for your money here.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.255
Watch the mountains.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.768
I still got him. He's still back there.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.898
Come on, mav.
Do some of that pilot shit.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.362
Yeah, I got him.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.123
Come on, bring it right.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.019
Goose, I've had about enough
of this shit.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.002
I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.583
Okay, you're mine.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.221
Jesus Christ.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.305
Let's see what you've got now, Jester.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.816
Okay, mav, let's turn and burn.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.536
He's going vertical, so am I.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.917
We're going ballistic, mav. Go get him.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.578
He's going for the hard deck.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.684
Let's get down there first
and nail him, mav.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.762
No way, Jester. You're mine.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.030
I got you now.

32:43.545 --> 32:44.830
Jester's dead.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.541
Jester's dead.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.176
Get your butts above the hard deck
and return to base immediately.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.720
Yes, sir.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.690
Tower, this is ghost rider
requesting a flyby.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.023
Negative, ghost rider,
the pattern is full.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.484
No. No, mav. This is not a good idea.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.901
Sorry, goose
but it's time to buzz the tower.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.831
Goddamn son of a bitch.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.337
Great balls of fire!

33:40.560 --> 33:41.720
Jester's dead.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.935
You won? That's bullshit.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.684
- Didn't everybody?
- Hell, no, man, we got our butts kicked.

33:47.067 --> 33:50.025
Thirty seconds.
We went like this, he went like that.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.935
I said to Hollywood, "where'd he go?"

33:52.030 --> 33:54.772
Hollywood just said, "where'd who go?"

33:55.200 --> 33:57.845
Yeah, and he's laughing at us,
right on the radio. He's laughing at us.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.530
No, it's me laughing, dickhead.

33:59.621 --> 34:00.656
We won.

34:00.747 --> 34:01.782
All right! All right!

34:01.873 --> 34:02.988
- All right.
- All right.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.414
They won too, man.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.995
That's not what I heard.

34:06.086 --> 34:08.998
- No, we did, we got Jester.
- No, no.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.489
Below the hard deck does not count.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.755
Hard deck, my ass.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.418
We nailed that son of a bitch.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.917
You guys really are cowboys.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.884
What's your problem, kazansky?

34:18.764 --> 34:20.221
You're everyone's problem.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.331
That's because every time
you go up in the air, you're unsafe.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.368
I don't like you
because you're dangerous.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.603
That's right.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.139
Iceman.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.308
I am dangerous.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.485
Maverick.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.885
You and goose get your butts
out of that flight gear

34:37.909 --> 34:39.445
and up to viper's office now.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.036
Remember, boys,

34:45.125 --> 34:46.911
no points for second place.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.106
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- Oh, you shut up, okay?

34:50.130 --> 34:52.121
- Don't worry. Goose, don't worry.
- Okay, I will.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.210
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys
did a flyby on my tower

34:55.302 --> 34:56.632
at over 400 knots!

34:56.969 --> 34:59.962
I want somebody's butt. I want it now.
I've had it.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.056
- Oh!
- God damn it!

35:03.143 --> 35:04.633
That's twice.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.134
I want some butts!

35:07.814 --> 35:10.430
Well, that'll just about cover the flybys.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.103
Follow me.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.947
Gentlemen.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.026
You had a hell of a first day.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.200
The hard deck for this hop
was 10,000 feet.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.500
You knew it, you broke it.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.787
You followed
commander heatherly below

35:33.882 --> 35:36.464
after he lost sight of you
and called no joy.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.635
- Why?
- Sir!

35:41.348 --> 35:44.181
I had commander heatherly
in my sights.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.474
He saw me move in for the kill.

35:46.561 --> 35:49.223
He then proceeded
below the hard deck.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.893
We weren't below 10,000
for more than a few seconds.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.645
I had the shot,

35:54.736 --> 35:57.523
there was no danger, so I took it.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.817
You took it.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.699
And broke a major rule of engagement.

36:03.703 --> 36:04.863
Then you broke another one

36:04.996 --> 36:06.907
with that circus-stunt flyby.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.415
Lieutenant Mitchell.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.835
Top gun rules of engagement
exist for your safety

36:13.922 --> 36:15.253
and for that of your team.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.498
They are not flexible, nor am I.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.502
Either obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?

36:23.848 --> 36:24.883
Yes, sir!

36:33.858 --> 36:34.938
Dismissed.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.697
I really enjoyed that, mav, thanks a lot.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.699
Holy shit.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.538
Maybe I could learn how
to be a truck driver.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.105
Mav, you have the number of that
truck-driving school we saw on TV?

36:54.129 --> 36:55.539
Truck master, I think it is.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.128
I might need that.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.960
His fitness report says it all.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.632
He's a wild card.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.406
Flies by the seat of his pants.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.715
Completely unpredictable.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.635
He got you, didn't he?

37:09.477 --> 37:10.557
Yeah.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.094
Maverick.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.305
I flew with his old man.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.936
Tell me one thing.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.109
If you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

37:24.242 --> 37:25.402
I don't know.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.401
I just don't know.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.299
You still awake? Yeah.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.511
What's up?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.680
Can't sleep.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.165
You know, when I first realized
that we were going to top gun,

37:54.189 --> 37:56.350
all I could think about
was getting that trophy.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.850
I gotta be straight with you, mav.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.195
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.567
I got a family to think about.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.280
I can't afford to blow this.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.118
Yeah, I guess that flyby wasn't
such a big hit, huh?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.460
Look, man, I know it's tough for you.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.154
They wouldn't let you in the academy

38:25.178 --> 38:26.964
because you're Duke Mitchell's kid and

38:27.847 --> 38:29.803
you have to live with that reputation.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.886
But it's like every time we go up there,

38:31.976 --> 38:34.058
it's like you're flying against a ghost.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.978
It makes me nervous.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.477
You're the only family I've got.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.655
I'm not gonna let you down.
I promise you.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.042
Get out of here.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.061
A rolling reversal would work well
in that situation.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.772
But if I reversed on a hard cross,
I could immediately go to guns on them.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.024
Yeah, but at that speed, it's too fast.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.189
It's a little bit too aggressive.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.862
Too aggressive.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.517
Yeah, I guess when I see something,

39:36.541 --> 39:37.747
I go right after it.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.758
You didn't tell me who you were
the other night.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.413
You didn't give me a chance, did you?

39:45.091 --> 39:46.456
You deserved it.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.795
I know.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.467
But

39:51.055 --> 39:52.545
you were tempted

39:53.600 --> 39:55.386
to ask me out for dinner.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.055
- No.
- No?

39:58.146 --> 39:59.226
No.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.225
I don't date students.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.907
I can see it's dangerous for you.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.242
But if the government trusts me,

40:16.915 --> 40:18.621
maybe you could.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.169
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.431
Crash and burn, huh, mav?

40:48.613 --> 40:49.613
Slider,

40:52.951 --> 40:54.111
you stink.

41:04.504 --> 41:05.539
Let's go.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.040
Okay, ice, yeah.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.300
All set.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.342
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.506
Back up, back up.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.299
Here it comes.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.266
That's good.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.389
Come on.

41:23.648 --> 41:24.648
Let's go, now.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.150
Come on, mav, let's get them.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.694
Those guys are animals.

41:43.835 --> 41:44.915
Let's go!

41:46.170 --> 41:47.205
Gol

41:47.338 --> 41:48.669
oh, good serve, good serve.

41:55.221 --> 41:56.336
All right!

41:57.432 --> 41:58.512
Yes!

42:00.018 --> 42:01.053
Yeah!

42:12.864 --> 42:14.195
That's game.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.487
Okay. Fake block.
Stay down. We'll just take them.

42:18.578 --> 42:19.693
Okay.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.413
Come on, where you guys going?
You walking away?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.328
We won, we won. Come on!

42:26.419 --> 42:28.034
Mav. Mav. Come on, man.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.857
Just one more game. That evens it up.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.417
- Come on, we can take them.
- No.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.549
No, we can, we got it.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.193
I got some things I gotta take care of.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.046
Take care of? Just one more game.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.052
Please? For me?

42:38.139 --> 42:39.219
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.300
- Come on.
- Come on!

42:40.391 --> 42:41.881
- Mother goose, you pussy!
- For me?

43:14.967 --> 43:16.127
Damn it.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.766
Lieutenant?

43:34.654 --> 43:37.612
- Yeah...
- What, no singing?

43:39.117 --> 43:42.484
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- No apologies.

43:50.962 --> 43:51.997
If you don't mind, I'm...

43:52.130 --> 43:53.357
I'm gonna just take a quick shower

43:53.381 --> 43:55.838
while you're finishing up here.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.333
Yeah, I do mind.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.341
I'm hungry.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.803
And then

44:07.478 --> 44:08.888
I thought about it.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.807
I thought,

44:12.150 --> 44:14.311
"you know, Charlie, he's a smart guy.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.689
"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here."

44:19.365 --> 44:20.650
Well?

44:21.993 --> 44:23.483
It's the mig.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.745
The mig.

44:29.709 --> 44:32.667
You're the only pilot
who's been up against a mig-28.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.687
I'm trying for this big promotion at work,

44:37.758 --> 44:39.874
and if I get it,
I'm not gonna be here much longer.

44:41.596 --> 44:44.008
It seems to me you've got it
all figured out.

44:44.432 --> 44:45.888
Yeah.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.349
Except you did forget the wine.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.601
Oh.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.351
Sorry.

44:55.401 --> 44:57.016
You always get what you want?

44:57.195 --> 44:58.526
No, not always.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.187
Yeah, maybe.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.022
Then relax about the mig.

45:18.716 --> 45:19.876
This music.

45:22.637 --> 45:24.047
An old friend?

45:26.224 --> 45:27.259
My folks loved it.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.049
I haven't heard this in years.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.808
My mother used to
call down from her room

45:34.899 --> 45:37.561
and have me play this
over and over again.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.771
I got so sick of it.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.730
But not her, she...

45:44.784 --> 45:47.491
Just sit up there alone,
just listening, hours.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.406
Just listening.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.083
She died shortly after him.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.918
What happened to your father?

46:03.928 --> 46:07.045
I guess I kind of figured,
with your security clearance,

46:07.139 --> 46:09.630
you'd know more about him than I do.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.926
- Well, I didn't get that far.
- Oh.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.646
Well, it's a big mystery.

46:19.819 --> 46:24.279
He disappeared in an f-4,
November 5th, 1965.

46:27.285 --> 46:28.775
The stink of it was,

46:29.620 --> 46:31.485
he screwed up.

46:32.665 --> 46:33.700
No way.

46:34.959 --> 46:36.699
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

46:41.007 --> 46:44.215
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.802
Somebody must know.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.464
Yeah, somebody knows everything.

46:52.351 --> 46:54.808
Is that why you're always
second best up there?

46:57.023 --> 46:58.308
You are direct, aren't you?

47:07.867 --> 47:09.152
I'm sorry I was late.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.694
I'm sorry for being direct.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.030
No apologies.

47:18.878 --> 47:20.709
This is gonna be complicated.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.674
Where are you going?

47:36.228 --> 47:37.718
I'm gonna take a shower.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.061
Thank you.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.734
I enjoyed being here.

48:24.110 --> 48:26.977
It looks like you need another shower.

48:28.948 --> 48:29.983
Right.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.245
I'm gonna be honest with you.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.743
Your mig sighting is really
important to my work, but...

48:49.510 --> 48:52.252
I don't normally invite
students to my house.

48:53.347 --> 48:54.803
You're...

49:02.773 --> 49:05.435
But... please understand,
I still have a job to do.

49:07.987 --> 49:09.022
- Morning.
- Sir.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.444
Morning.

49:32.511 --> 49:34.843
I'm glad we got that straight.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.485
I told her how tough it is here.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.568
You know, my ass dragging
like an old, tired dog.

49:58.662 --> 50:00.622
I told her that you didn't
even have a woman here.

50:00.664 --> 50:01.664
Oh, really.

50:01.832 --> 50:02.867
You know what she said?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.560
Said, "oh, he probably
doesn't have one,

50:04.668 --> 50:05.828
"he's got eight.â

50:13.010 --> 50:15.672
Hi! _daddy!

50:21.977 --> 50:23.183
So, Maverick,

50:23.479 --> 50:26.721
goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.394
- Is that right?
- I didn't tell her that.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.983
Yes, you did. Ll.

50:31.195 --> 50:32.714
- Yes, you did.
- I can't believe you said that.

50:32.738 --> 50:34.569
- That was a secret.
- No.

50:40.829 --> 50:42.945
The bogey has good position right here.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.746
All right, freeze-frame.

50:45.084 --> 50:46.494
Moment of choice.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.541
The f-14 is defensive.

50:48.837 --> 50:50.702
He has a chance to bug out right here.

50:51.215 --> 50:54.423
Better to retire and save your aircraft

50:55.261 --> 50:57.001
than push a bad position.

50:57.596 --> 50:59.552
Charlie, jump in here anytime.

51:00.099 --> 51:02.385
Now, you stay in that diamond
another three seconds,

51:02.768 --> 51:05.225
the bogey's gonna blow you
out of the sky.

51:05.354 --> 51:08.312
You take a hard right, select zone five,

51:08.399 --> 51:10.355
you can extend an escape.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.521
You made a bad choice.

51:14.613 --> 51:15.728
Charlie.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.907
Aircraft one performs a split s?

51:21.412 --> 51:23.368
That's the last thing you should do.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.196
The mig's right on your tail.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.872
Freeze there, please.

51:27.710 --> 51:31.043
The mig has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking at this point?

51:31.922 --> 51:34.004
You don't have time to think up there.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.501
If you think,

51:35.593 --> 51:36.753
you're dead.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.042
Well, that's a big gamble

51:38.137 --> 51:40.378
with a $30 million plane, lieutenant.

51:47.896 --> 51:49.761
Unfortunately, the gamble worked.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.896
The mig never got a clean shot.

51:53.152 --> 51:55.768
Maverick makes
an aggressive vertical move here,

51:55.904 --> 51:59.146
comes over the top, and he defeats
the bandit with a missile shot.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.823
The encounter was a victory,

52:01.952 --> 52:06.161
but I think that we've shown it
as an example of what not to do.

52:07.625 --> 52:08.785
Next.

52:09.918 --> 52:11.783
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

52:15.924 --> 52:20.133
Now, then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook maneuver.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.477
Lieutenant.

52:39.114 --> 52:40.604
Maverick.

52:43.035 --> 52:44.150
Lieutenant.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.119
Lieutenant.

52:47.956 --> 52:50.242
My review of your flight performance
in the tacts

52:50.334 --> 52:52.290
was right on,
in my professional opinion.

52:53.128 --> 52:54.538
I can't hear you.

53:15.484 --> 53:16.894
Jesus Christ!

53:17.027 --> 53:18.187
And you think I'm reckless!

53:18.320 --> 53:19.506
When I fly, I'll have you know

53:19.530 --> 53:21.896
that my crew and my plane come first!

53:22.032 --> 53:24.444
Well, I'm going to finish
my sentence, lieutenant.

53:24.535 --> 53:27.026
My review of your flight
performance was right on.

53:27.162 --> 53:28.902
- Is that right?
- That is right.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.571
But I held something back.

53:30.999 --> 53:32.955
I see some real genius
in your flying, Maverick,

53:33.043 --> 53:34.533
but I can't say that in there.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.592
I was afraid that everyone
in that tacts trailer

53:36.714 --> 53:38.204
would see right through me.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.507
And I just don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.

55:28.158 --> 55:29.614
Hey, Maverick. Yeah.

55:29.701 --> 55:30.986
You hear about ice?

55:31.954 --> 55:33.990
- What's that?
- He won another one.

55:34.665 --> 55:36.030
Really? Yeah.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.532
I feel the need,

55:39.378 --> 55:41.835
- the need for speed.
- The need for speed.

55:46.051 --> 55:48.133
Gentlemen, this is hop 19.

55:48.220 --> 55:50.461
Multiple aircraft, multiple bogies.

55:50.556 --> 55:52.171
Your training is half over.

55:52.349 --> 55:55.011
The competition for the top gun trophy
remains tight.

55:55.143 --> 55:56.428
First place, iceman.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.011
Second place, Maverick,
just two points behind.

56:00.858 --> 56:03.315
There they are.
Three miles, left, 10 o'clock.

56:03.402 --> 56:04.504
I don't think they see us yet.

56:04.528 --> 56:05.688
Okay, I see them.

56:05.863 --> 56:08.730
Two a-4s, left 10 o'clock level,
continue left turn.

56:18.041 --> 56:20.623
Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperature's 110 degrees.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.201
Holy shit, it's viper.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.374
Viper's up here, great.

56:24.882 --> 56:26.042
Oh, shit.

56:26.550 --> 56:29.667
Great. He's probably saying,
"holy shit, it's Maverick and goose."

56:29.761 --> 56:31.547
Yeah, I'm sure he's saying that.

56:35.183 --> 56:36.844
I've got my eye on the northern bogey.

56:36.935 --> 56:38.596
Roger. I got the Southern guy.

56:41.064 --> 56:43.100
Hollywood, you've got the lead,
I'll cover you.

56:56.079 --> 56:57.444
Break now, Jester.

57:02.210 --> 57:04.542
Hollywood, we're losing viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

57:04.630 --> 57:05.745
Roger, I'm on him.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.752
Goose, find viper.
He's out there somewhere.

57:12.888 --> 57:15.721
Stay with Hollywood, mav,
we're covering his wing.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.925
Goose, there's viper. 3 o'clock, low.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.264
Stay with Hollywood, mav.
We're his cover.

57:22.397 --> 57:24.103
Don't you leave me, Maverick.

57:24.441 --> 57:26.272
Hollywood, you're looking good.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.267
I'm going after viper.

57:31.323 --> 57:32.938
God damn you, Maverick.

57:33.075 --> 57:34.360
Mav, don't leave him.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.318
Goose, Hollywood's okay. I want viper.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.324
Stand by. Viper's coming down.

57:49.800 --> 57:53.634
Holy shit, we're head-to-head.
I can't believe we're doing this.

58:08.318 --> 58:09.318
Rock 'n' roll.

58:09.444 --> 58:11.480
Here's our chance.
It's a big one, goose.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.151
Come on, god damn it.

58:18.996 --> 58:20.532
Come on, mav, keep coming.

58:24.793 --> 58:26.749
Okay. Sidewinder missile selected.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.828
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

58:28.964 --> 58:31.876
Come around, come around.
That's it, that's it.

58:37.639 --> 58:38.879
Jesus, this guy's good.

58:39.224 --> 58:41.010
Goose, where's he going?

58:41.143 --> 58:42.804
Come on, come on, come on,
keep coming.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.680
Keep coming!

58:48.025 --> 58:49.356
Come on, baby.

58:54.990 --> 58:56.526
Damn, this kid's good.

58:58.035 --> 59:00.367
He's too close for missiles, goose,
I'm switching to guns.

59:03.749 --> 59:05.535
Come on, come on, come on.

59:08.211 --> 59:10.668
Stick with me, stick with me.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.383
What... hold it. Goose, check our tail.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.217
Shit. There's Jester.

59:18.513 --> 59:20.879
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

59:21.016 --> 59:22.051
Shit.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.051
The defense department
regrets to inform you

59:25.187 --> 59:27.724
that your sons are dead
because they were stupid.

59:28.565 --> 59:30.601
Great balls of fire.

59:31.234 --> 59:32.815
Okay, knock it off, gentlemen.

59:32.903 --> 59:34.609
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

59:40.368 --> 59:42.359
Thirty seconds, wolfman,
and I'm coming in.

59:43.288 --> 59:44.368
Shut up!

59:44.456 --> 59:45.741
God, buttnose!

59:46.583 --> 59:48.949
That was some of the best
flying I've seen yet,

59:49.086 --> 59:51.247
right up to the part where you got killed.

59:51.588 --> 59:53.920
You never, never leave your wingman.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.591
Maverick,

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.057
it's not your flying,

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:07.804
it's your attitude.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.220
The enemy's dangerous,

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.432
but right now
you're worse than the enemy.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:16.226
You're dangerous and foolish.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.730
You may not like the guys
flying with you, they may not like you,

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.111
but whose side are you on?

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:33.956
Well, at least viper got iceman
before he got us.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.671
We still got a shot at it.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:40.129
That was stupid. I know better than that.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.302
It'll never happen again.

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:48.133
I know.

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:54.476
I know.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.977
You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.854
thinking about your love
drives a man insane

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.356
you break my will

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.857
oh, what a thrill

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.944
goodness gracious, great balls of fire

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.658
Maverick, would you go fetch him?

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:51.030
- Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
- Goose? Hell, no.

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.699
- Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:56.121
- What?
- Come on.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.710
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with penny Benjamin.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.712
Did he? Well, that's great.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:05.445
He tells me about all of them, Maverick.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.715
How my little angel, goose,
goes home early for church,

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:13.059
and you, you always go home
with the hot women.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.556
All right, thank you, Carole.

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.390
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with goose for a while.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.643
Dancing!

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.485
You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.238
thinking "bout your love
drives a man insane

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.241
you broke my will, oh, what a thrill

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:35.248
goodness gracious, great balls of fire

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.330
I would love to be able
to warn you off about Maverick,

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.412
but I just love him to death.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:45.087
You know, ll've known Pete
for a lot of years now, and...

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:47.594
I'm telling you, one thing's for certain.

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:50.013
There are hearts breaking wide open

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.886
all over the world tonight.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.349
Why?

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.552
Because unless you are a fool,

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.767
that boy is off the market.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.518
He is 100 percent,

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.271
prime-time in love with you.

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:05.778
Hey, goose, you big stud!

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.189
That's me, honey.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.366
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.242
Show me the way home, honey.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.281
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.704
You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.706
thinking about your love
drives a man insane

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:27.710
you broke my will, oh, what a thrill

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.092
goodness gracious, great balls of fire

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.572
Maverick,

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.492
you big stud,

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.657
take me to bed or lose me forever.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.337
Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.338
Two weeks to graduation.

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:16.675
Top gun trophy is still up for grabs,
so every point counts.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.054
Well, it's bottom of the ninth,
the score is tied.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.726
It's time for the big one.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.307
You up for this one, Maverick?

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.734
Just a walk in the park, kazansky.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:14.528
Contact. Multiple bogies, 165.

01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:16.909
Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.738
Ho, I see them, tallyho, right 2 o'clock.
I'm in.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.073
I'm in.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.095
That son of a bitch cut me off.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:53.696
Come on, come on. Jesus Christ.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.360
Ice, take the shot.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.443
Come on, ice, get the hell out of there.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:59.390
I can't get the angle.
I'm too close for missiles.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:00.779
I'm switching to guns.

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.706
Ice, fire or clear.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:13.291
Look at this! Jesus Christ,
I can take a shot right here!

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:15.627
I need another 20 seconds,
then I've got it.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.805
I'm moving in. I've got the shot.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.308
Come on, mav, let's get in there!
Come on, mav!

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:29.222
Maverick's getting impatient, ice.
Come on, take the shot.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:30.813
Ten more seconds, then I've got him.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:35.818
Come on, ice, get the hell out of there!
Let's do it, mav.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.570
Ice, come off high right. I'm in.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.493
- Five more seconds.
- Come off high right, ice. I'm in.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.161
I'm off. Shit!

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:46.825
We're in his jet wash!

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.456
Ho! Holy shit!

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:54.170
This is not good.
Shit, we got a flameout, mav.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:55.917
Engine one is out.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.343
Engine two is out!

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.074
Goose, I'm losing control.
I'm losing control.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:02.181
I can't control it. It won't recover. Shit.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.598
It's coupling up, mav!
We're out of control.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.680
This is not good! This is not good!

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.356
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.601
He's in a flat spin.
He's heading out to sea.

01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:18.690
Altitude 8,000, 7,000.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.861
Six. We're at six, mav.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.499
I'm pinned forward, goose.
I can't reach the ejection handle.

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:31.873
Goose, you're gonna
have to punch us out.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:33.621
I can't reach the ejection handle.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.707
- Eject.
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:37.333
Eject! Eject! Eject!

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:39.173
Watch the canopy!

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:59.072
Goose! Goose! Oh, no!

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:01.239
Ohl

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.161
oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.246
Oh...

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.051
Oh, god.

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.540
Sir, let go of him.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.712
You gotta let him go, sir.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.127
How you doing?

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:42.962
I'm all right.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:48.298
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:56.018
You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens.

01:09:57.777 --> 01:10:00.985
He was my rio, my responsibility.

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:07.028
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost eight of 18 aircraft.

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:08.651
Ten men.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.863
First one dies, you die too.

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:14.824
But there will be others.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.457
You can count on it.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.998
You gotta let him go.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.386
You gotta let him go.

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:47.189
I think maybe it was my fault.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.243
Nah.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:55.160
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:10:59.744
I'd like to help.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.921
I know it's difficult.

01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:09.920
God, I want him back.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:19.188
I'll be here if you need me, okay?

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.970
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.198
But he'd have flown anyway

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.326
without you.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:42.240
He'd have hated it,
but he would've done it.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.775
We find that the f-14 flat spin
was induced by the disruption of airflow

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.359
into the starboard engine.

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:14.280
This disruption stalled the engine,

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.696
which produced enough yaw rate

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:22.121
to induce a spin
which was unrecoverable.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:26.292
There was no way lieutenant Mitchell
could either see or avoid the jet wash

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.126
which produced the engine stall.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.295
Therefore, the board of inquiry finds

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.214
that lieutenant Pete Mitchell
was not at fault

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.041
in the accident of 29 July.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:36.868
Lieutenant Mitchell's record
will be cleared of this incident.

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:40.389
Lieutenant Mitchell is restored
to flight status without further delay.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.642
These proceedings are closed.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.896
Get him up flying, soon.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.175
Come on, kid, come on.
Get in there. Engage.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.431
All right, you got a bogey
at 2 o'clock low, Maverick.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.513
You got the angle. Piece of cake, pal.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.435
Take the shot, kid. Take the shot.

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.981
You can engage any time, Maverick.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.369
- Hey, where the hell are you going?
- It's not good.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:53.041
It... it doesn't look good.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.526
What do you mean,
it doesn't look good?

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.270
It doesn't get to look
any better than that.

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:10.888
Hey, man, we could've had him.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.311
Hey, we could've had him, man!

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:17.653
I will fire
when I am goddamn good and ready!

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:19.817
You got that?

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.713
He can't get back in the saddle.
Won't engage.

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:43.212
It's only been a few days.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.216
You know, he just might
not make it back.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:51.429
Keep sending him up.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:12.408
Mitchell.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.878
I'm sorry about goose.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.421
Everybody liked him.

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.599
I'm sorry.

01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:50.116
Hi, it's wolfman.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:55.163
Yeah, Maverick just quit.

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:18.811
Excuse me.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:23.983
May 1?

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:25.981
Please.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.413
I'll have what he's having.

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:38.873
Hemlock, is it?

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:41.288
Ice water.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:48.463
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.184
I heard you got that job in Washington.

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:56.686
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:02.188
But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.940
Well...

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.073
It's good to see you.

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.109
Thanks.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:13.904
Where you going?

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.741
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:22.167
Listen, I've seen all the evidence,
and it's not your responsibility.

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:25.173
It's not your fault.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.545
You're one of the best pilots
in the Navy.

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:34.050
What you do up there, it's dangerous.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:37.602
But you've got to go on.

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:40.685
No, you don't understand.

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:43.225
When I first met you,

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.733
you were larger than life.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.403
Look at you.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.363
You're not gonna be happy
unless you're going mach 2

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.448
with your hair on fire, you know that.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:59.158
No, it's over.

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:02.460
- It's just over.
- To be the best of the best

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:05.415
means you make mistakes
and then you go on.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:06.874
It's just like the rest of us.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.960
Oh, you don't think I know that?

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:13.468
I'm here to help.

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:16.846
Look, thank you.

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:22.273
But if I wanted help, really,
I would have asked for it.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.272
So I'm too late.

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:34.197
You've already left.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.994
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.249
Except to quit.

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:47.338
You've got that maneuver down
real well.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.303
So long, Pete Mitchell.

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.540
Well, hi, Maverick, come on in.

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.413
- How are you doing?
- Good.

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:28.735
Really? You sure?
You sure you're feeling

01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:30.362
- okay with everything?
- Oh, I feel great.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.422
Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:34.504
- or anything else like that?
- No, thank you.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:35.700
Okay, well, why don't you just...

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.160
- Thank you very much.
- Make yourself comfortable

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.544
- because Mike will be right down, okay?
- Great, thank you.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.870
I flew with your old man.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.662
Vf-51, the oriskany.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.499
You're a lot like he was.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.460
Only better

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.383
and worse.

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:17.755
He was a natural heroic
son of a bitch, that one.

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:23.977
So he did do it right.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:30.525
Yeah, he did it right.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.159
Is that why you fly the way you do?

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.711
Yeah, your old man did it right.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:53.590
What I'm about to tell you is classified.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.258
It could end my career.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:58.136
We were in the worst dogfight
I ever dreamed of.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:02.345
Bogies like fireflies all over the sky.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.472
His f-4 was hit, he was wounded,
but he could've made it back.

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.729
He stayed in it,
saved three planes before he bought it.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:15.341
How come I never heard that before?

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:17.844
Now, that's not something
the state department tells dependents

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:20.530
when the battle occurred
over the wrong line

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:21.781
on some map.

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:24.617
So you were there?

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.706
I was there.

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.497
What's on your mind?

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.458
My options, sir.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:34.877
Simple.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:38.843
First, you've acquired enough
points to show up tomorrow

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:41.138
and graduate with your top gun class.

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:43.469
Or you can quit.

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:46.685
There'd be no disgrace.

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:50.894
So you think I should quit?

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:52.812
I didn't say that.

01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:57.738
The simple fact is,
you feel responsible for goose,

01:23:57.824 --> 01:24:00.110
and you have a confidence problem.

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:04.328
Now, I'm not gonna sit here and blow
sunshine up your ass, lieutenant.

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:08.366
A good pilot is compelled to
always evaluate what's happened.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.661
So he can apply what he's learnt.

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:14.625
Up there, we gotta push it.

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:17.465
That's our job.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:23.635
It's your option, lieutenant, all yours.

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:37.937
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir,

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:39.987
but thank you very much for your time.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.361
No problem. Good luck.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:32.953
Gentlemen...

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:34.647
- Where's Maverick?
- Here at top gun,

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:36.441
we challenged you
to fly against the very best.

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.625
I don't know where he is.

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.331
Now, we ask you to take
that expertise...

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:41.041
You know what he's planning to do?

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:43.218
And keep the tradition alive.

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:44.824
Gotta be hard on the guy,
though, you know?

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.213
Good luck.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.918
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.751
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, mav.

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:25.385
Sir.

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:29.176
Gentlemen.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.930
I hate to break up the party
before it really gets out of hand,

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.352
but there 1s work to be done.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:37.101
Some of you have to
depart immediately.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.898
We have a crisis situation.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:40.813
Ice, slider.

01:26:40.904 --> 01:26:42.110
Yo.

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.028
- Hollywood, wolfman.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:47.236
Maverick.

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:48.692
Sir.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.948
Maverick, you'll get your rio
when you get to the ship.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.000
And if you don't,

01:26:58.004 --> 01:26:59.289
give me a call.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.746
I'll fly with you.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:04.583
Sir.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.095
Gentlemen, this is bull's-eye.

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:19.523
The communication ship
ss Layton has become disabled

01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:21.941
and has wandered into foreign territory.

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:24.360
A rescue operation is to begin
within the hour.

01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:27.531
Your mission is to give
air support to that rescue.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:30.693
There are migs in the area,
and tensions are high.

01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:34.621
If you witness a hostile act,
you will return fire.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:38.158
Those migs carry
the exocet anti-ship missile.

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.915
They can fire that missile
from 100 miles away.

01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:43.038
Gentlemen, this is the real thing.

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:45.423
This is what you've been trained for.

01:27:45.552 --> 01:27:49.386
You are America's best. Make us proud.

01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:51.054
- Ice.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.221
- Hollywood.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:53.389
Sector two.

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.889
And Maverick, you back them up
with Merlin on ready five.

01:27:57.522 --> 01:27:59.228
Yes, sir.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:01.393
Risel

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:04.234
excuse me, sir. Yes.

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:07.571
This is not personal,
but with regard to Maverick,

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.485
is he the best backup that...

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:11.942
I know what's on your mind,
kazansky, just get on it.

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:31.050
Mustang, when you get the chance,
can you give me a mode-four check?

01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:34.487
Voodoo one, you've got a pair
of bogies, 12 o'clock, 15 miles.

01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:38.867
Voodoo one, voodoo one,
090 radar contact 15 miles.

01:29:38.957 --> 01:29:40.618
They're doing 500 knots.

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:41.994
Roger, that's your bogey.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:48.330
Got them dead ahead, 15 miles,
air speed is 600 knots.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.715
Bogies' air speed, 650.
We're a little close together.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.170
Let's take a wider split.

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.508
They're at 15,000 feet now,
dead ahead, ten miles.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:01.142
Air speed is still increasing.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:04.187
Eight hundred knots.
Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.

01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:07.019
- Dead ahead, now, 8 miles.
- Wood, you got them?

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.350
Not yet, I can't see them.

01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:10.231
They must be close,
I'm getting a hard-on.

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:19.698
Okay, wood, I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify them.

01:30:19.789 --> 01:30:21.495
Roger, ice, you got the lead.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.539
I'm on your left side, a little low.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:27.915
- Maverick's up and ready in alert five.
- Good, good.

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:32.048
Hollywood, my bogeys still locked up.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.042
He's drifting to the left.

01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:37.337
Still maneuvering, course 090.

01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:42.139
Okay, wood, let's bring it to the right,
and we'll get a better angle on them.

01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:52.894
Ice, we got a problem here.

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:54.467
Now I'm breaking out
four aircraft on the radar.

01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:56.982
Not one pair, two pair.
Repeat, four bogies.

01:30:57.077 --> 01:30:58.487
Wood, we've got four bogies.

01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:02.825
Wrong! Make that five!

01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:03.951
There's five, sir.

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:05.953
- That's five?
- Yes, sir.

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:09.085
Oh, shit!

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:11.295
He's got a radar lock on us!

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:16.338
Get out of there, Hollywood!
Get out of there, goddamn it!

01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:24.676
Break left!

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:27.137
I'm hit! I'm hit! We're coming apart!

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:28.938
I can't control it! Hold on!

01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:30.640
Zero for twenty! We're going down!

01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:32.004
Wood's been hit! Wood's been hit!

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:33.484
Shit! Wood's been hit!

01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:35.687
Voodoo one! Wood's been hit!
Wood's been hit!

01:31:35.782 --> 01:31:37.989
We've lost Hollywood!
Repeat, we've lost Hollywood!

01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.658
- We've lost our wingman.
- Launch Maverick on alert five.

01:31:40.787 --> 01:31:42.698
Get a bearing on
Hollywood and wolfman

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:45.121
and launch the rescue
helicopter immediately.

01:32:11.901 --> 01:32:14.021
- Maverick"s airborne.
- Iceman, what's your position?

01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:16.440
090 at 180 miles.

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:18.317
Yeah, we're coming in left!

01:32:18.658 --> 01:32:20.819
Three migs, dead ahead,
coming down the left side.

01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:25.370
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:30.867
We got four on our tail!
That makes six of them!

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:33.169
Who do you think is hooking
in the guns range?

01:32:37.677 --> 01:32:39.292
He's firing! Break right!

01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:43.242
Mustang, this is voodoo one,
we are totally defensive.

01:32:43.266 --> 01:32:44.346
Launch the alert fighters.

01:32:44.434 --> 01:32:45.469
Where? Where are they?

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.596
A hundred and sixty miles
and closing in fast, sir.

01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:50.019
Ready Willard and simkin
off cats three and four.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:55.058
Maverick's supersonic.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

01:32:55.153 --> 01:32:56.964
Move your ass! Get up here!
I'm engaged with five.

01:32:56.988 --> 01:32:58.694
Repeat, five. I'm in deep shit!

01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:02.566
What about Willard and simkin?

01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:05.929
Both catapults are broken.
We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

01:33:06.289 --> 01:33:07.870
- How long?
- It'll take ten minutes.

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:10.352
Bullshit, ten minutes.
This thing will be over in two minutes.

01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:11.866
Get on it!

01:33:13.505 --> 01:33:15.871
One mig, 12 o'clock high!
One mig, 12 o'clock high!

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:18.540
Watch your back! Watch your back!

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.591
Break right!

01:33:26.893 --> 01:33:28.303
Shit, that was close!

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.622
Maverick, how about
some help down here?

01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:31.887
- Where the hell are you?
- Come on, kid, hang in there.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.890
Jesus Christ.

01:33:37.946 --> 01:33:40.187
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddamn it!

01:33:42.325 --> 01:33:44.657
Maverick, we got a mig on our tail.

01:33:47.163 --> 01:33:48.699
Watch out! Watch out!

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:53.492
Shit, we just flew
right through his jet wash.

01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:57.624
Get control, mav! Get control!

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:06.630
Good recovery, mav.

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:08.636
Okay, let's get in there.

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:10.550
Come on, we gotta help ice.

01:34:10.728 --> 01:34:12.719
Come on, let's get back
in the game, Maverick!

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:14.917
- Come on! Get in there, Maverick!
- No. It's no good.

01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:16.431
It's no good.

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:20.602
God damn it! Maverick's disengaging!

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:22.153
I knew it! Shit!

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.696
God damn it, Maverick!

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:28.631
Get in there, Maverick!
You can't leave him!

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:30.975
Come on! Maverick!
What the hell are you doing?

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:32.034
Talk to me, goose.

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:33.227
Maverick, get in there, for Christ's sake!

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:35.242
- Ice is in trouble!
- Talk to me, goose.

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:37.481
Get in there, Maverick!
He won't last down there alone!

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:38.961
Get in the fight, for Christ's sake!

01:34:39.048 --> 01:34:41.505
Maverick! Maverick!

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:45.926
Maverick's reengaging, sir.

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:54.686
- I can't get him off my tail!
- Ice, I've got your mig dead ahead.

01:34:54.772 --> 01:34:56.182
I've got him dead ahead.

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:59.390
Good tone. I've got good tone.

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:01.976
I've got tone! I've got tone! Firing!

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:15.494
- Where? Where are they?
- A hundred and fifty-five miles.

01:35:15.668 --> 01:35:18.000
Two migs, dead ahead.
Closing at 800 miles an hour.

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:20.567
I see them. I see them.
I'm gonna take them down the left side.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.040
Oh, my god.

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:29.387
Ice is right below us.
He's got a mig on his tail.

01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:33.850
He's firing! Break left! Break left!

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.306
He overshot! He overshot!

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:41.690
Coming in, ice. I'm coming in.

01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:45.854
I got two migs dead ahead.

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:49.198
I got him, mav.
One mig passing between us.

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.872
You got a mig on your left. On your left!
3 o'clock!

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:57.620
He's gonna fire, he's gonna fire!

01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:06.153
Maverick, check the guys to the north!

01:36:06.177 --> 01:36:07.713
Check the guys to the north!

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:12.387
Banking left. Banking left.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:17.055
There he is. Get him, ice. Get him!

01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:18.720
Okay, you guys, I'm coming in!

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.464
Maverick, we got a mig
coming around on our tail!

01:36:25.488 --> 01:36:28.070
- We gotta get out of here!
- I can't leave ice.

01:36:28.157 --> 01:36:30.569
He's still coming around!
He's gonna get behind us!

01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:32.821
I'm not leaving my wingman.

01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:38.039
I'm on his tail. I'm on his tail.
I'm going for it.

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:40.104
I'm going for it.
I'm going for the shot right now.

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:41.743
Roger. Engaged.

01:36:43.923 --> 01:36:45.333
I've got radar lock.

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:47.795
Good tone. I'm taking a shot.

01:36:47.927 --> 01:36:49.087
Firel

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:55.260
bingo! Wash that sucker, yeah!

01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:57.037
Ice, watch out.
There's a mig to your right.

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:58.221
He's firing!

01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:01.437
I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:37:03.609 --> 01:37:05.212
We're hit! We're hit in the right engine!

01:37:05.236 --> 01:37:06.942
I'm shutting it down!
I'm shutting it down!

01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:13.191
Coming in, ice. Coming in.

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:19.451
Ice, that bogey's still behind you.
I'm maneuvering for a shot.

01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:21.449
Stay with him, mav, stay with him!

01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:22.904
Take the shot! Nail him! Nail him!

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:24.793
Shit. Ice, I can't get a tone.

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.963
Shoot, Maverick!
I can't get him off my tail!

01:37:31.554 --> 01:37:32.865
Maverick, we're hit! We're hit again!

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:35.096
It's okay. Both engines are functioning.
We're okay.

01:37:35.183 --> 01:37:37.640
Ice, on the count of three,
break hard right.

01:37:38.603 --> 01:37:39.638
Three,

01:37:39.729 --> 01:37:40.809
two,

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:42.762
one. Break right!

01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:46.857
Firing!

01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:51.771
Damn it, I missed!

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:54.608
Don't let him go. Keep on him, mav.
Keep on him.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.283
I got him. I got him.

01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:59.411
Here comes a shot.

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:05.955
Scratch three!

01:38:08.049 --> 01:38:09.568
Maverick, move!
There's a mig on your tail!

01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:10.798
There's a mig on your tail!

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:12.821
We've got a problem here.
We've only got one missile left.

01:38:12.845 --> 01:38:14.551
Approaching 110 miles, sir.

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:15.845
God damn it.

01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:17.242
I got him! I got him! He's right on us!

01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:18.631
He's between our tails!

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.972
Shit.

01:38:26.275 --> 01:38:27.915
You haven't lost him. He's still with us!

01:38:32.031 --> 01:38:33.550
What are you doing?
You're slowing down!

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:34.689
You're slowing down!

01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:36.184
I'm bringing him in closer, Merlin.

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:37.529
You're gonna do what?

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.081
This is it, Maverick!

01:38:44.168 --> 01:38:45.928
I'm gonna hit the brakes,
he'll fly right by.

01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:47.543
Shit! He's gonna get a lock on us!

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:52.290
Now!

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:59.381
I got a good lock. Firing.

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:05.553
Scratch four!

01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:11.566
Mustang, this is voodoo three.

01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:13.360
Remaining migs are bugging out.

01:39:28.337 --> 01:39:31.295
Mustang, this is Maverick
requesting flyby.

01:39:32.341 --> 01:39:34.081
Negative, ghost rider.
The pattern is full.

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:38.969
Excuse me.
Something I should know about?

01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:52.817
Thank you.

01:39:58.242 --> 01:39:59.903
God damn that guy.

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:25.300
Yes!

01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:55.371
What the hell happened
to you guys? Hollywood!

01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:56.960
You!

01:41:00.763 --> 01:41:02.344
You are still dangerous.

01:41:06.686 --> 01:41:08.893
You can be my wingman anytime.

01:41:10.147 --> 01:41:11.262
Bullshit.

01:41:11.357 --> 01:41:12.722
You can be mine.

01:42:04.827 --> 01:42:06.488
- Maverick.
- Sir.

01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:08.265
How does it feel to be on the front page

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:10.209
of every newspaper
in the english-speaking world?

01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:12.715
Even though the other side
denies the incident.

01:42:12.752 --> 01:42:14.413
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

01:42:14.712 --> 01:42:16.148
They gave you your choice of duty, son.

01:42:16.172 --> 01:42:18.003
Anything, anywhere.
Do you believe that shit?

01:42:18.674 --> 01:42:21.211
Where do you think you wanna go?

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:23.960
I thought of being an instructor, sir.

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:26.262
Top gun?

01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:27.881
Yes, sir.

01:42:28.476 --> 01:42:29.636
God help us.

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:51.224
Hello, Pete Mitchell.

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:59.013
I heard the best of the best
were gonna be back here,

01:43:59.108 --> 01:44:00.644
so...

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:07.567
This could be complicated.

01:44:09.577 --> 01:44:13.411
You know, on the first one,
I crashed and burnt.

01:44:14.999 --> 01:44:16.079
And the second?

01:44:23.507 --> 01:44:24.747
I don't know,

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:29.919
but it's looking good so far.
