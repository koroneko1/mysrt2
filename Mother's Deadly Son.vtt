00:01.669 --> 00:02.835
(dramatic music)

00:05.080 --> 00:08.507
(woman & man breathing heavily)

00:12.588 --> 00:15.597
(kissing sounds
and more breathing)

00:18.019 --> 00:20.761
- [woman] that feels so good.

00:20.855 --> 00:24.248
(rattlesnake rattling)

00:24.341 --> 00:26.483
(passionate breaths continue)

00:27.920 --> 00:29.177
- Stop!

00:29.196 --> 00:30.845
Please don't do this!

00:30.865 --> 00:31.864
Jacob!

00:33.425 --> 00:34.258
Jacob!

00:34.351 --> 00:37.036
Please, you don't
have to do this!

00:38.021 --> 00:41.689
(passionate breathing continues)

00:41.709 --> 00:43.283
Jacob!

00:43.435 --> 00:44.785
We can figure this out!

00:44.937 --> 00:46.795
We can talk through this!

00:47.715 --> 00:51.050
(passionate breathing builds)

00:53.721 --> 00:55.804
Jacob!

00:58.875 --> 01:02.227
(dramatic music continues)

01:03.898 --> 01:04.955
(mourners chattering)

01:05.048 --> 01:06.790
- I'm so sorry.
- Terrible tragedy.

01:06.883 --> 01:07.624
- [mourner] I just can't believe

01:07.717 --> 01:08.567
He's gone.
- Please, call me

01:08.794 --> 01:09.960
If you need anything.
- So young.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.737
- [female mourner] we're
gonna miss him so much.

01:12.907 --> 01:16.075
(gentle somber music)

01:24.585 --> 01:25.900
- [stephanie] oh my god.

01:25.994 --> 01:26.993
Oh, this is my favorite one.

01:27.088 --> 01:27.902
- [nathan] what a clown.

01:27.996 --> 01:28.979
I can't believe he wrote that.

01:29.072 --> 01:29.996
- [stephanie]
stop, it's so cute.

01:30.149 --> 01:30.738
- [nathan] look at
this right here.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.833
Man, he was so cheesy.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.985
- He was romantic.

01:35.003 --> 01:36.169
- I probably should have
had a bigger problem

01:36.322 --> 01:38.488
With him dating my
younger sister than I did.

01:38.582 --> 01:40.340
- [stephanie] don't
be a jerk, nathan.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.082
- [marianne] hi, guys.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.917
- Mrs. Davis.

01:43.011 --> 01:44.845
- Hey, is it, uh,

01:44.939 --> 01:46.179
Okay that we're in here?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.848
- Yeah, of course.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.108
He used to love to play,

01:49.335 --> 01:51.001
Especially with you.

01:51.094 --> 01:53.595
- My first t-ball
team, he was on it.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.504
- I remember.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.449
You always pushed
him to be better.

01:57.676 --> 01:59.025
- I didn't have to at
this last season though.

01:59.178 --> 02:01.603
I mean, I kind of
passed him the torch.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.938
- You didn't pass him the torch.

02:04.032 --> 02:05.182
He just got better than you.

02:05.200 --> 02:05.958
- Shut up, steph.

02:07.369 --> 02:08.961
Such a girlfriend thing to say.

02:09.872 --> 02:11.446
- Stay as long as you like.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.132
The food will be ready soon.

02:13.359 --> 02:15.025
- Cool.

02:15.043 --> 02:16.451
Thank you mrs. Davis.
- Yeah, thank you.

02:16.545 --> 02:21.306
(upbeat pounding electronic
music) (video game beeping)

02:22.959 --> 02:24.868
- What is it?

02:24.961 --> 02:25.978
- You need to come downstairs.

02:26.129 --> 02:28.630
People would like to
pay their respects.

02:28.724 --> 02:30.965
- So people can
just lie to my face?

02:31.059 --> 02:32.542
- Why would you think that?

02:32.636 --> 02:34.302
- They'll tell me
how sorry they are,

02:34.396 --> 02:35.470
But behind my back,

02:35.564 --> 02:37.281
They'll just blame
me for ayden's death.

02:38.901 --> 02:41.160
- Honey, nobody blames you.

02:41.311 --> 02:42.977
- They think I killed him.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.330
(tense music)

02:46.500 --> 02:47.741
- Can we talk about
this later, please,

02:47.835 --> 02:49.126
And just come downstairs now?

02:50.004 --> 02:52.671
(jacob scoffs)

02:56.919 --> 02:57.843
(nathan and stephanie laughing)

02:57.994 --> 02:59.845
- [nathan] why
would he write that?

02:59.996 --> 03:01.421
- What are you guys doing?

03:01.573 --> 03:02.514
- Just reminiscing.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.257
- Your mom said
that it was okay.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.517
- That's not your stuff.

03:05.669 --> 03:07.352
It's ayden's.

03:07.504 --> 03:08.187
Give me that.

03:08.338 --> 03:09.837
- Hey man, easy.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.097
- Jacob.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.340
- And this.
- I'm sorry.

03:12.434 --> 03:14.084
I just, I couldn't
remember what I wrote him.

03:14.102 --> 03:14.943
- I don't care.

03:15.771 --> 03:16.937
You shouldn't be in here.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.513
Get out.
- Okay.

03:18.607 --> 03:19.489
Okay, we're leaving.

03:23.204 --> 03:28.165
- Sorry.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.880
(marianne clears throat)

03:41.129 --> 03:43.371
- Marianne, I just-
(marianne gasps)

03:43.390 --> 03:44.056
I'm so sorry.

03:44.207 --> 03:45.449
I just came in to help.

03:45.542 --> 03:46.058
I didn't mean to startle you.

03:46.285 --> 03:46.892
I just...

03:47.119 --> 03:48.301
- It's fine.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.803
It's fine.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.898
Thank you so much for being
here for me for everything.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.399
Thank you.
- Of course.

03:56.128 --> 03:56.884
- Thank you.
- Everything right?

03:56.904 --> 03:57.794
What happened?

03:57.887 --> 04:00.405
- Oh, I just dropped the salad.

04:00.632 --> 04:02.908
Now I don't know what
I'm gonna serve but...

04:03.135 --> 04:04.076
- It doesn't matter.

04:04.303 --> 04:05.911
Just try to be more
careful, all right?

04:07.414 --> 04:08.989
- Daniel, it was an accident.

04:09.083 --> 04:09.656
- It was my fault.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.991
I snuck up on her.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.066
- Yeah, well maybe if
you weren't in here

04:12.086 --> 04:13.585
Trying to do
everything yourself,

04:13.737 --> 04:14.828
It wouldn't have happened.

04:14.922 --> 04:15.903
- Were you coming in to help?

04:15.998 --> 04:18.498
- No, no, no, because if I did,

04:18.592 --> 04:20.166
You'd tell me that I was
doing everything wrong.

04:20.319 --> 04:22.836
- Mm-hmm.
- It was on me, okay?

04:22.930 --> 04:23.911
- You know, and maybe,

04:24.006 --> 04:25.655
Maybe if you didn't
try to control

04:25.674 --> 04:27.657
Every single aspect
of their lives,

04:27.751 --> 04:28.842
They wouldn't have
felt it necessary

04:28.994 --> 04:31.419
To sneak off to the
quarry like they did.

04:31.513 --> 04:34.014
- Are you seriously blaming me?

04:34.166 --> 04:35.757
Daniel, you are the one

04:35.776 --> 04:38.277
Who makes every single
thing a competition.

04:38.504 --> 04:40.094
Everything!

04:40.114 --> 04:41.521
That's why the boys
went up there that day

04:41.615 --> 04:42.856
Because of you!

04:43.008 --> 04:44.432
You!

04:44.526 --> 04:46.267
- Guys, it was an accident!

04:46.287 --> 04:47.769
Okay?

04:47.863 --> 04:50.772
It was a stupid, ugly accident.

04:50.866 --> 04:51.865
And ayden was a grown boy,

04:51.959 --> 04:55.185
He was 17, and he should
have known better.

04:55.278 --> 04:56.962
But you still have
a son who needs you.

04:57.113 --> 04:58.038
So I don't think
either one of you

04:58.132 --> 04:59.131
Wants to say something

04:59.282 --> 05:00.716
That you can't take
back right now.

05:02.878 --> 05:04.469
- Well, that's my
cue for another beer.

05:06.381 --> 05:07.806
- Do you really
think you need one?

05:09.701 --> 05:10.534
- Yeah.

05:10.627 --> 05:12.794
I just buried my
oldest son today.

05:12.888 --> 05:15.147
Excuse me if I don't
count my beers.

05:22.806 --> 05:23.471
- I'll go.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.156
- No.

05:25.217 --> 05:26.566
Do you mind?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.826
- Yes, yes, of course.

05:28.053 --> 05:28.827
- Thanks.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.999
- It is a tragedy.

05:34.226 --> 05:35.500
- It's such tragedy.

05:35.727 --> 05:36.484
It's crazy.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.561
- But here's the thing though,

05:37.654 --> 05:39.913
Everybody knows
jacob's been jealous

05:40.007 --> 05:41.089
Of ayden his whole life.

05:42.401 --> 05:43.400
Right?

05:43.418 --> 05:45.827
- Nobody really
knows what happened.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.595
- Shh.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.423
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:50.576 --> 05:52.017
- Thank you for coming.

05:52.244 --> 05:54.478
- I heard the police
are getting involved.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.356
Those two boys never got along.

05:57.507 --> 05:59.691
Always fighting.

05:59.918 --> 06:01.860
- [female mourner] have
to get an investigator.

06:03.105 --> 06:05.113
Is there? There needs to be.

06:06.850 --> 06:07.866
Not an accident.

06:08.093 --> 06:08.608
(people chattering)

06:08.702 --> 06:10.369
- I'll be right back.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.290
- You really think you
should be drinking?

06:18.879 --> 06:19.836
- Why does it matter?

06:22.608 --> 06:23.882
- I just don't think your
mother would approve.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.051
- She wanted me to mingle.

06:26.202 --> 06:28.111
I'm mingling.

06:28.130 --> 06:29.846
- I'm pretty sure this
isn't what she meant.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.967
- What are you doing?

06:34.119 --> 06:35.877
You're 16 and drinking?

06:35.971 --> 06:37.020
Put the beer down, son.

06:38.548 --> 06:39.398
Put the beer down.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.900
(jacob scoffs)

06:42.051 --> 06:44.144
- I mean, if I were
a betting woman,

06:44.296 --> 06:45.629
I would put my vacation home

06:45.647 --> 06:48.365
On jacob gave his
brother a little push.

06:50.969 --> 06:51.985
- Excuse me?

06:52.137 --> 06:53.470
- Oh, dear.

06:53.488 --> 06:55.472
How are-
- don't dear me.

06:55.565 --> 06:58.992
How dare you come
into my house today

06:59.144 --> 07:00.143
And say something like that?

07:00.236 --> 07:01.661
Jacob had nothing
to do with ayden...

07:01.813 --> 07:04.831
(daniel and jacob screaming)

07:04.925 --> 07:06.258
- Somebody do something!

07:06.485 --> 07:08.151
- Stop it, stop it!

07:08.170 --> 07:09.928
Stop it, stop it!

07:10.155 --> 07:11.263
What are you doing?

07:11.414 --> 07:14.007
- He's out here embarrassing
us, drinking beer!

07:14.101 --> 07:15.600
- Take it down, okay?

07:15.752 --> 07:16.768
Take it down.

07:16.995 --> 07:18.178
- I haven't spanked
him since he was five,

07:18.272 --> 07:19.679
Since you convinced me not to.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.922
But I think it's about time -

07:20.941 --> 07:22.774
(fist thuds)
(all gasping)

07:22.926 --> 07:25.193
(tense music)

07:34.362 --> 07:36.621
- Jacob, jacob.

07:37.866 --> 07:39.182
It really is a good school.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
- It's a military
school for delinquents.

07:42.187 --> 07:44.704
- No, it's a, it's a
place to help young men

07:44.856 --> 07:46.447
Who need structure
get structure.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.692
- Is that what the
brochure told you?

07:48.785 --> 07:50.952
- Honey, we're
doing this for you.

07:51.046 --> 07:52.637
If there was any other way-

07:52.864 --> 07:54.139
- There is.

07:54.366 --> 07:54.931
Tell dad no.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.792
Tell him you're not
gonna ship me off.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.145
(car horn honks)

08:00.372 --> 08:00.979
- Let's go.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.708
- Look, if you need anything,

08:04.801 --> 08:06.651
Will you please call me
at anytime for anything?

08:08.137 --> 08:08.820
Can I get a hug?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.474
(gentle music)

08:13.494 --> 08:15.827
(jacob scoffs)

08:17.389 --> 08:17.996
I love you.

08:21.076 --> 08:24.002
(car engine revs)

08:32.070 --> 08:34.971
(militaristic music)

08:39.244 --> 08:42.771
- All right, who's back
here burning something?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.010
Freaking davis.

08:49.104 --> 08:51.029
Should have guessed.

08:51.256 --> 08:53.114
You could have sent
this whole building up.

08:54.609 --> 08:55.942
And cheat sheets.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.702
Kiss graduation goodbye.

08:57.929 --> 08:58.537
Let's go.

09:01.116 --> 09:04.267
(phone vibrating)

09:04.286 --> 09:06.962
(marianne groans)

09:12.553 --> 09:13.718
- Hello.

09:13.945 --> 09:15.111
- [commander greg]
this is commander greg.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.112
I'm sorry to inform you

09:16.205 --> 09:18.056
Cadet jacob davis
has been expelled.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.951
- Sorry.

09:21.970 --> 09:24.120
Can you say that again, please?

09:24.139 --> 09:26.881
- [commander greg] he needs
to be off base by 0900.

09:26.975 --> 09:28.733
Should we call someone else?

09:28.885 --> 09:30.902
- No, no need to
call anyone else.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.071
I'll come get him.

09:33.222 --> 09:34.364
- [commander greg]
thank you, ma'am.

09:43.141 --> 09:45.658
- What is it? What's wrong?

09:45.752 --> 09:46.993
- Jacob.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.145
(militaristic music)
(chanting marching cadences)

09:49.164 --> 09:51.423
You burned a trash can.

09:51.650 --> 09:53.817
- And he was caught
burning cheat sheets.

09:53.835 --> 09:55.010
- Is that true?

09:56.746 --> 09:57.987
Thank you.

09:58.006 --> 09:58.988
Get up.

09:59.007 --> 09:59.931
Let's go.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.434
(jacob scoffs)

10:03.829 --> 10:08.607
(soldiers chanting)
(gentle somber music)

10:23.790 --> 10:25.373
- Are you going to say anything?

10:34.784 --> 10:35.375
(dog barking)

10:35.469 --> 10:37.135
- [camilla] sit. Sit.

10:38.029 --> 10:40.363
- You are a shedder.

10:40.382 --> 10:41.047
(camilla giggles)

10:41.199 --> 10:42.641
Do you see all this hair?

10:42.868 --> 10:44.625
Oh my gosh.

10:44.719 --> 10:45.268
All over the place.
- Yeah.

10:52.210 --> 10:52.984
Hey, babe.
- Hi.

10:54.729 --> 10:56.229
- Oh, here, let me
grab that for you.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.397
- It's not a bother, I got it.

10:57.549 --> 10:59.491
- No, I don't mind.
- I said I got it.

11:00.719 --> 11:01.493
- All right.

11:01.644 --> 11:03.995
(soft tense music)

11:04.147 --> 11:06.498
(dog barking)

11:06.725 --> 11:07.666
(dog growls)

11:07.817 --> 11:09.167
- Sorry, she's usually
really friendly.

11:10.896 --> 11:11.336
- That's all right.

11:11.563 --> 11:12.837
Dogs don't like me.

11:18.494 --> 11:19.678
- So that's jacob.

11:19.829 --> 11:20.470
- [kyle] yeah.

11:22.908 --> 11:23.756
- You want a snack?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.332
- Sure.
- Come on.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.936
(dog barking)

11:36.196 --> 11:39.364
(gentle somber music)

11:40.516 --> 11:43.034
(doorbell rings)

11:45.764 --> 11:46.446
Hey.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.280
- Hey.

11:47.432 --> 11:48.206
- What are you doin' here?

11:48.357 --> 11:50.208
- Well, I figured
you'd had a day

11:50.435 --> 11:52.877
So I brought you some
food and some wine.

11:53.104 --> 11:54.103
- Thank you.

11:54.197 --> 11:55.696
You're gonna stay
for dinner, right?

11:55.716 --> 11:56.606
- I can stay.

11:56.624 --> 11:57.865
This just needs to be warmed up.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.700
- You know where the oven is.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.219
Great.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.628
You know what, actually I'm
gonna call jacob to come down

12:02.723 --> 12:04.556
Because he has not left
his room since he got home.

12:04.783 --> 12:05.724
- Oh boy.

12:05.951 --> 12:07.041
I'll start pouring.

12:07.135 --> 12:07.892
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.520
- Jacob!

12:12.899 --> 12:13.815
Jacob!

12:16.385 --> 12:17.384
(knocking on door)

12:17.479 --> 12:18.811
Jacob, tara's here.

12:18.905 --> 12:19.988
Come down and say hello.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.742
(soft tense music)

12:23.969 --> 12:24.868
Jacob.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.580
(marianne sighs)

12:29.657 --> 12:32.333
(marianne groans)

12:35.756 --> 12:37.830
- It's almost midnight, honey.

12:37.924 --> 12:38.739
What do you wanna do?

12:38.833 --> 12:41.985
- I don't know. I don't know.

12:42.078 --> 12:44.429
- Why don't we go drive
around and look for him?

12:46.415 --> 12:48.324
- Let's just say if he's
not home by midnight then-

12:48.343 --> 12:51.752
(phone vibrating)

12:51.772 --> 12:53.012
Hello?

12:53.106 --> 12:53.921
- [detective sanchez] I'm
looking for mrs. Davis.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.331
- Yes.

12:55.350 --> 12:56.015
- [detective sanchez]
this is detective sanchez.

12:56.167 --> 12:56.682
We have jacob in holding.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.777
You need to come down.

12:59.004 --> 13:00.186
- Okay.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.097
Yes, thank you. I'm on my way.

13:03.191 --> 13:05.842
- [detective sanchez]
see you soon.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.118
- Who was that?

13:07.345 --> 13:08.620
- Police.

13:08.771 --> 13:09.788
They have jacob.

13:15.870 --> 13:17.462
- At least he's safe, right?

13:20.025 --> 13:20.632
Okay.

13:21.951 --> 13:23.301
Go get your boy.

13:23.528 --> 13:24.135
- Okay.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.137
Oh.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.308
- Jacob.

13:33.705 --> 13:35.438
That's quite a file
for a young man.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.059
- Did you call my mom?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.227
Is she coming to get me or what?

13:41.379 --> 13:43.804
- You know, I never
got the full story

13:43.824 --> 13:45.782
Of what happened that
night your brother died.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.978
Mind sharing?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.980
- I already told you
guys what happened.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.982
- Just in an initial
interview at the scene

13:55.076 --> 13:56.742
Which lacks detail.

13:56.837 --> 13:57.502
How about this?

13:57.729 --> 13:58.837
You tell me what happened,

13:59.064 --> 14:01.581
I'll understand why
you were there tonight,

14:01.675 --> 14:02.732
Maybe I could just let you go.

14:02.825 --> 14:04.801
Not even wait to
hear from the owner.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.679
- Like I said two years ago...

14:08.664 --> 14:09.589
- [ayden] wanna do this again?

14:09.683 --> 14:10.831
- We were just
challenging each other

14:10.851 --> 14:11.574
Like we always did.
- Remember what happened

14:11.667 --> 14:12.425
Last time?

14:12.577 --> 14:14.077
Whoever gets to the top first.

14:14.095 --> 14:15.745
- That's right.

14:15.763 --> 14:16.762
First to the top.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.005
- I don't know why
you're pushing this,

14:18.099 --> 14:20.191
But I'll give you one
last chance to back out.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.178
All right. Your funeral.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.755
You know, you've never
beaten me to the top before,

14:25.773 --> 14:26.698
So I don't know
why you think today

14:26.849 --> 14:28.758
Is gonna be any different.

14:28.776 --> 14:30.785
- Maybe I was just
lacking proper motivation.

14:34.782 --> 14:38.101
(timer beeping)

14:38.119 --> 14:41.437
(frantic music)

14:41.530 --> 14:42.696
- [ayden] come on,
little brother.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.773
You're losing.

14:43.791 --> 14:45.216
- [jacob] shut up
and keep climbing.

14:46.869 --> 14:47.793
It's not over yet.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.629
- Just admit defeat now.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.890
Easier to climb down at
this point than go up.

14:53.968 --> 14:57.312
- I'm - not - quitting.

14:58.456 --> 14:59.546
- Fine.

14:59.641 --> 15:00.481
See you at the top.

15:06.889 --> 15:07.572
- Damn it!

15:07.723 --> 15:08.740
He was too fast.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.408
I couldn't keep up.

15:10.559 --> 15:11.817
I couldn't see him anymore

15:11.912 --> 15:13.912
And I was looking for a
hold when I heard him scream

15:14.973 --> 15:17.749
And I saw him fall
past me from the top.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.418
- [ayden] no!

15:25.333 --> 15:26.591
- What happened after that?

15:30.655 --> 15:32.913
- I climbed down and
just called the police.

15:33.007 --> 15:35.582
- So ayden's phone was a timer.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.085
You didn't tell that
to the officer before.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.771
It's not listed in the evidence.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.589
You know what happened
to ayden's phone?

15:42.609 --> 15:43.441
- No.

15:44.927 --> 15:45.777
- The bet.

15:47.948 --> 15:48.947
What was on the line?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.357
- Bragging rights.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.266
Just bragging rights.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.434
- Jacob.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.619
Do not say another word.

15:56.272 --> 15:58.364
- We were just
talking, mrs. Davis.

15:58.516 --> 15:59.374
- Just talking, huh?

16:00.276 --> 16:01.960
Is he under arrest or not?

16:02.187 --> 16:02.794
- Nope.

16:03.871 --> 16:05.371
The owner said as long
as there's no damage,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.857
He didn't wanna press charges.

16:07.950 --> 16:09.300
Seems he must know
your ex-husband.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.786
- You said you were
waiting to hear from him.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.930
- Did I?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.265
- Jacob, let's go.

16:17.793 --> 16:20.311
(dramatic music)

16:22.890 --> 16:23.648
- Your son's lying.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.634
- What are you talking about?

16:27.729 --> 16:28.728
You caught him trespassing.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.712
There's no damage,

16:29.731 --> 16:31.047
So there's nothing to lie about.

16:31.065 --> 16:32.490
- Not about that.

16:32.641 --> 16:33.474
- About what?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.900
- About your other son's death.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.238
Oh, his story was right in
line to what he said before,

16:39.332 --> 16:40.665
But you know what?

16:41.726 --> 16:43.559
I just don't believe him.

16:43.578 --> 16:44.669
His story doesn't add up.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.914
- That is absolutely ridiculous

16:49.009 --> 16:50.491
Because he loved his brother.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.917
- Maybe.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.679
But I did hear they were
competitive with each other.

16:56.424 --> 16:58.257
Maybe just in a fit of rage

16:58.351 --> 16:59.425
Of losing to his brother

16:59.519 --> 17:00.601
Yet again-
- jacob!

17:02.080 --> 17:03.688
- He just gave
him a little push.

17:04.749 --> 17:06.265
- Jacob, no!

17:06.417 --> 17:08.151
No!

17:08.862 --> 17:10.936
- And you killed him.

17:11.031 --> 17:11.771
You know, for bragging rights.

17:11.923 --> 17:15.015
I-
- do not say a word.

17:15.109 --> 17:16.534
He didn't kill his brother.

17:16.761 --> 17:18.870
- Then why didn't you
let us do an autopsy?

17:19.021 --> 17:21.113
It would've put a lot of
these questions to bed.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.767
- Because I was not about to
let somebody cut up my son

17:24.786 --> 17:25.877
On some wild goose chase.

17:26.104 --> 17:26.711
That's why!

17:26.938 --> 17:27.795
Let's go.

17:29.365 --> 17:30.798
- Thanks for the conversation.

17:37.706 --> 17:40.058
- Jacob, what were you thinking?

17:40.209 --> 17:41.893
You couldn't go one night.

17:43.621 --> 17:45.045
And why there of all places?

17:45.139 --> 17:46.731
- I wasn't doing anything.

17:47.550 --> 17:48.399
I just wanted to...

17:50.403 --> 17:52.295
I just wanted to see it again.

17:52.313 --> 17:53.029
- But why?

17:54.966 --> 17:55.907
I wanna understand.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.640
- [jacob] what are you doing?

18:04.659 --> 18:05.750
- Is there something
you need to tell me?

18:05.901 --> 18:07.210
- No, mom!

18:08.479 --> 18:09.328
- Really?

18:09.480 --> 18:10.496
- No!

18:10.648 --> 18:11.905
- Because detective
sanchez is pretty intent

18:11.925 --> 18:13.907
On proving his point.

18:14.001 --> 18:16.410
So if there's something that
you've been keeping from me,

18:16.504 --> 18:17.595
Now's the time to tell me.

18:19.490 --> 18:22.433
Jacob, I'm just trying
to talk to you, okay?

18:24.771 --> 18:25.770
- Can we please go home?

18:27.832 --> 18:28.397
- Sure.

18:29.517 --> 18:32.735
(tense music continues)

18:42.455 --> 18:44.789
(gentle music)

18:48.519 --> 18:49.776
Coffee?

18:49.796 --> 18:50.870
- Just made a fresh pot.

18:51.022 --> 18:51.871
- Okay.

18:51.965 --> 18:52.964
Yes, you did.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.541
- Is he up yet?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.117
- Probably not.

18:57.211 --> 18:58.136
He likes to sleep late.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.141
What?

19:07.981 --> 19:10.481
(door clicks)

19:16.138 --> 19:18.138
- My bad. Just trying
to be courteous.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.048
- By sneaking around the back?

19:19.066 --> 19:20.399
- No, I saw you in the front,

19:20.551 --> 19:21.308
Saw you walk into the back,

19:21.327 --> 19:22.902
Thought I'd save you the trip.

19:23.054 --> 19:24.328
You know, courteous.

19:25.890 --> 19:26.998
- What do you need?

19:27.225 --> 19:29.558
- Were you even gonna
tell me that jacob's home?

19:29.577 --> 19:30.984
- Yes, I was going to call you.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.395
- Oh, you were, huh?
- Yes.

19:32.413 --> 19:33.987
- And that he got arrested.

19:34.081 --> 19:35.247
- They just picked him up.

19:35.400 --> 19:35.915
- Really?

19:36.067 --> 19:37.008
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:37.159 --> 19:39.010
I had to find out
from my old boss.

19:39.237 --> 19:41.012
Do you even know how
embarrassing that is?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.073
Tell me why he's not in school.

19:44.166 --> 19:44.682
Tell me why he got kicked out.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.742
Tell me everything.

19:46.835 --> 19:47.977
All right, and
don't protect him.

19:49.004 --> 19:50.337
Tell me the truth.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.023
- There was a fire

19:52.250 --> 19:54.083
And he got caught
burning cheat sheets.

19:54.101 --> 19:55.251
- That school is not cheap.

19:55.344 --> 19:57.010
I've been busting my
ass to keep him there.

19:57.104 --> 19:59.605
- I know. So have I.

19:59.757 --> 20:00.923
But look,

20:00.942 --> 20:02.683
There's something that
he is not telling me.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.777
I mean, he was a month
away from graduation

20:04.929 --> 20:06.445
And something must
have happened.

20:06.597 --> 20:08.873
- Yeah, he happened.

20:09.024 --> 20:10.766
It's what he does.

20:10.785 --> 20:12.601
Somebody needs to knock
some sense into him.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.712
- [jacob] and how do you
plan on doing that, dad?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.050
- Something that should
have happened two years ago.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.535
Let's go, big man.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.036
Come on.

20:23.130 --> 20:23.963
Why'd you get kicked out?

20:24.115 --> 20:25.038
- Stop.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.540
- Big man.
- Stop!

20:26.559 --> 20:27.800
You can leave now.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.210
- Were you cheating?
- You need to leave, I said!

20:30.230 --> 20:31.637
- Yeah, walk away.

20:31.789 --> 20:33.064
- You walk away.
- I'm leaving!

20:36.978 --> 20:37.735
- [marianne] go inside.

20:38.980 --> 20:39.904
Inside.

20:41.632 --> 20:42.556
(dog barks)

20:42.650 --> 20:44.742
- Can somebody move
this stupid dog?

20:47.747 --> 20:50.489
- I did not expect
him to just stop by.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.084
- Hey, so is this like how
things are gonna be now?

20:53.995 --> 20:57.588
- No, we're just adjusting.

20:59.650 --> 21:00.424
- [jacob] all right.

21:01.928 --> 21:02.927
- All right, what?

21:03.078 --> 21:04.428
- I'm going for a run.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.098
- Do you want breakfast first?

21:07.325 --> 21:08.007
- No.

21:08.159 --> 21:09.267
I'll get something later.

21:09.494 --> 21:10.101
Bye.

21:11.162 --> 21:11.752
- Bye.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.513
(soft tense music)

21:14.607 --> 21:17.233
(marianne sighs)

21:35.962 --> 21:36.627
- Morning.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.449
- Can I help you with something?

21:42.468 --> 21:43.950
- Nope. Just out for a drive.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.529
- Don't you have something
more important to do today?

21:46.547 --> 21:49.640
- Well, I am off today, but no.

21:51.202 --> 21:53.035
- You're unbelievable, man.

21:53.054 --> 21:55.054
- I think we all
want the same thing,

21:55.206 --> 21:56.129
For you to stay outta trouble.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.148
That's all I'm doing.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.965
Just trying to make
sure that happens.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.543
- You're harassing me.

22:00.561 --> 22:01.152
- Whoa.

22:02.471 --> 22:03.821
You approached me.

22:15.242 --> 22:17.335
You stay outta trouble now.

22:20.915 --> 22:21.630
Hmm.

22:23.659 --> 22:26.344
(soft tense music)

22:36.022 --> 22:38.689
(dryer rumbling)

22:52.763 --> 22:53.871
- Hey, mom.

22:54.022 --> 22:55.781
- Hey, what are you doing?

22:55.933 --> 22:56.932
- I'm looking for work.

22:57.025 --> 22:59.101
Researching how to get my ged.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.103
- That's great.

23:01.196 --> 23:02.955
Let me know if
you need any help.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.106
Are you doing a wash?

23:04.125 --> 23:05.941
- Yeah.

23:05.960 --> 23:06.792
I know how to do laundry.

23:06.944 --> 23:07.868
- Okay.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.203
- I've done it for
like two years.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.964
- Do you always wash
your tennis shoes?

23:12.116 --> 23:13.557
- I just splashed
through some mud.

23:14.785 --> 23:15.393
- Okay.

23:16.804 --> 23:17.520
Continue.

23:25.813 --> 23:26.570
- Princess!

23:27.798 --> 23:29.055
Princess!

23:29.075 --> 23:31.867
(soft tense music)

23:34.805 --> 23:36.229
Princess!

23:36.323 --> 23:37.915
- Hey, everything okay?

23:38.066 --> 23:39.308
- I can't find princess.

23:39.326 --> 23:41.919
She's not in the house
and she's not out here.

23:42.146 --> 23:43.921
- Well, I am sure
that she's somewhere.

23:45.316 --> 23:47.983
Jacob, have you seen princess?

23:48.002 --> 23:48.926
- Yeah.

23:49.153 --> 23:49.985
Earlier when I came
back from my jog

23:50.078 --> 23:52.655
She was yapping
so I let her out.

23:52.748 --> 23:54.173
- She's not an outdoor dog.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.842
- I thought she had to go
out to go to the bathroom.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.602
- You should have asked.

23:58.754 --> 24:00.512
- She can get out
through the fence.

24:00.665 --> 24:01.755
- Sorry.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.665
- Listen, don't worry.

24:02.758 --> 24:04.016
We are gonna go find her, okay?

24:04.168 --> 24:04.775
- We?

24:06.003 --> 24:07.019
- We.

24:07.171 --> 24:08.687
Let's go.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.447
We'll be back.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.025
(jacob scoffs)

24:13.177 --> 24:14.359
Princess.

24:14.512 --> 24:15.286
- Princess.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.438
- [marianne] princess.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.698
- [jacob] over there.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.017
(ominous music)

24:22.036 --> 24:22.793
- Oh my god.

24:24.038 --> 24:25.111
Help me with her, help me.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.112
- [jacob] she's gone.

24:26.132 --> 24:26.855
- No, she's not gone.

24:26.874 --> 24:27.798
She's still breathing.

24:27.950 --> 24:28.799
- No, she's suffering.

24:34.031 --> 24:35.864
Do you want me to...

24:35.883 --> 24:36.548
- No, we are not doing that.

24:36.701 --> 24:37.975
Put that down. Drop it.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.037
- I'll get her.

24:42.056 --> 24:43.314
It's my fault this happened.

24:44.709 --> 24:45.316
- Hurry.

24:48.988 --> 24:49.895
Well?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.155
- I'm so sorry.

24:52.808 --> 24:53.732
- I can't find princess.

24:53.884 --> 24:56.051
- She was yapping
so I let her out.

24:56.070 --> 24:56.994
- Thank you.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.145
- You're welcome.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.333
(gentle somber music)

25:04.395 --> 25:05.127
- Let's go.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.005
- All right, sweetie.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.252
Okay.

25:13.404 --> 25:16.088
(soft music)

25:16.240 --> 25:17.181
Chapter 20.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.018
"jacob poot changes the plan."

25:22.188 --> 25:24.355
The last note died
away in the distance.

25:24.506 --> 25:26.098
Our boys, who in
their vein effort,

25:26.250 --> 25:27.674
Felt they were skating backwards

25:27.693 --> 25:28.751
And turned to look
at one another.

25:28.844 --> 25:30.361
- Can somebody move
this stupid dog?

25:32.773 --> 25:35.090
It's my fault this happened.

25:35.109 --> 25:37.926
(ominous music)

25:37.945 --> 25:39.261
Is it done?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.779
- [kyle] just like a dream.

25:40.931 --> 25:41.539
- No.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.375
No, it's not.

25:45.527 --> 25:46.210
But your tea is.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.841
Here you go. Good night.

25:56.113 --> 25:56.720
- Hmm.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.891
(gentle music)

26:12.646 --> 26:13.629
- So what do you
want, detective?

26:13.647 --> 26:14.387
- Come on.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.298
You know why I'm here.

26:16.317 --> 26:17.908
- Jacob did not kill ayden.

26:19.136 --> 26:22.321
- You really believe
that a hundred percent?

26:22.473 --> 26:23.080
- Yep.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.493
- You know they had a cute
little dog, didn't they?

26:28.646 --> 26:29.661
- What?

26:29.814 --> 26:31.738
- A jack russell at
the home of your ex.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.923
Princess was the name, right?

26:34.242 --> 26:36.051
Yeah, it was found
mutilated yesterday.

26:37.488 --> 26:39.096
Dead.

26:39.323 --> 26:40.747
- That's too bad. I
didn't, I didn't know.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.674
- Yeah, that's one
thing about killers.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.103
When they're young, they
have certain markers,

26:47.255 --> 26:50.107
Torturing animals,
setting fires.

26:51.944 --> 26:52.610
Sound familiar?

26:54.672 --> 26:55.571
I called his school.

26:57.599 --> 26:58.949
I know why he got kicked out.

27:01.028 --> 27:02.077
See why I'm uneasy?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.938
- So what do you want?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.248
- Maybe the same thing as you.

27:10.020 --> 27:14.632
(upbeat electronic music)
(video game beeping)

27:17.303 --> 27:19.452
- Hey, can you turn it down
or put your headphones on?

27:19.472 --> 27:20.304
It's kind of loud.

27:24.977 --> 27:25.625
(remote clicks)

27:25.645 --> 27:27.202
- Hey!

27:27.221 --> 27:29.054
- Do you wanna talk
about yesterday?

27:29.206 --> 27:31.482
- What is there to talk about?

27:32.893 --> 27:33.984
It's not like it was a brother.

27:36.547 --> 27:37.488
- We're gonna talk later.

27:41.051 --> 27:44.887
(upbeat electronic music)
(video game beeping)

27:44.905 --> 27:47.723
(phone ringing)

27:47.741 --> 27:48.481
Hey, tara.

27:48.575 --> 27:49.725
I'm so glad you called.

27:49.743 --> 27:50.909
I-
- marianne, listen.

27:51.061 --> 27:53.745
The police are at ayden's
grave with a backhoe.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.063
- They're what?

27:55.082 --> 27:55.747
- [tara] I think they're
exhuming ayden's body.

27:55.900 --> 27:56.674
Hurry.

27:56.901 --> 27:57.749
- Thank you.

27:57.902 --> 28:00.678
(suspenseful music)

28:17.029 --> 28:19.822
(backhoe rumbling)

28:25.095 --> 28:25.703
Hey!

28:28.098 --> 28:29.448
Stop!

28:29.600 --> 28:30.207
Stop!

28:32.953 --> 28:33.877
- Keep going.
- Stop!

28:35.789 --> 28:38.048
Stop! What are you doing?

28:38.200 --> 28:39.216
What is this?

28:39.367 --> 28:41.719
- It's a court order
to exhume the body.

28:41.946 --> 28:42.869
- Ayden.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.722
His name is ayden.

28:44.873 --> 28:48.225
- To exhume ayden's body
and do a proper autopsy

28:48.452 --> 28:50.953
Like it should have
been done two years ago.

28:51.046 --> 28:52.212
- No judge would
sign off on this.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.897
- You're probably right.

28:54.124 --> 28:55.858
That's why I had to
get parental consent.

28:56.718 --> 28:59.903
(gentle somber music)

29:01.966 --> 29:03.799
- You signed off on this?

29:03.817 --> 29:04.575
- I had to.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.872
(backhoe rumbling)

29:12.918 --> 29:15.878
(marianne crying)

29:28.416 --> 29:29.600
(soft tense music)

29:34.331 --> 29:36.089
- Hey, what's this?

29:36.183 --> 29:37.274
What are you doing?

29:38.185 --> 29:39.443
- We're going to a hotel.

29:41.522 --> 29:43.171
- You're moving out?

29:43.190 --> 29:45.190
- Camilla doesn't feel safe.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.266
- Is it jacob?

29:46.360 --> 29:48.026
Did he do something or?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.194
- Yeah, honestly,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.179
The fact that you
would even ask me that

29:51.198 --> 29:52.790
Tells me that we need to leave.

29:52.941 --> 29:55.441
- I'll never forgive
him for princess.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.128
- Honey, we don't even know
what happened to princess.

29:58.355 --> 30:00.038
I mean the vet said that
it could be anything.

30:00.190 --> 30:00.872
- Yeah.

30:01.025 --> 30:02.524
Anything.

30:02.543 --> 30:03.616
- You're letting other people's

30:03.636 --> 30:05.377
Unfounded judgment cloud you.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.953
- I heard him.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.621
I heard what jacob
said about princess.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.123
That it was no big deal.

30:10.217 --> 30:11.883
Well, it is a big deal.

30:12.036 --> 30:13.051
- No, honey.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.387
He was making a
comparison to his brother.

30:15.539 --> 30:16.146
That's all.

30:17.632 --> 30:18.965
- Look, like you said,

30:19.059 --> 30:21.134
This whole thing is gonna
be a big adjustment, right?

30:21.153 --> 30:23.320
So we're gonna leave,

30:23.471 --> 30:24.988
You stay at the house,

30:25.140 --> 30:26.565
And once the dust
settles on all this

30:26.717 --> 30:29.827
We'll figure us out.

30:32.056 --> 30:33.055
- Okay.

30:34.149 --> 30:37.742
Will you let me know
where you, where you land,

30:37.895 --> 30:39.244
Where you end up staying or?

30:39.396 --> 30:40.078
- Yeah.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.321
Yeah, of course.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.172
- [marianne] okay.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.015
(car door beeping)

31:08.092 --> 31:09.700
- [jacob] hey, mom.

31:09.851 --> 31:11.351
- In here.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.944
- Can I have the car?

31:13.097 --> 31:14.187
I thought I'd grill
some burgers and dogs

31:14.206 --> 31:15.021
Tonight for everyone.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.023
It's no makeup for princess.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.360
I just gotta do
something, you know?

31:20.379 --> 31:22.004
- It's just gonna be us tonight.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.030
I'll get you the keys.

31:24.124 --> 31:27.050
(gentle piano music)

31:29.555 --> 31:30.721
- What's wrong?

31:30.872 --> 31:31.555
- Nothing.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.225
We can talk at dinner.

31:39.806 --> 31:40.856
I'm just gonna go lay down.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.364
(gentle somber music)

32:04.164 --> 32:05.981
- He's always been trouble.

32:05.999 --> 32:07.315
- You heard what
really happened.

32:07.409 --> 32:09.760
- I heard he's always been
jealous of his brother.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.504
- [female shopper] how can
she even live with him?

32:12.656 --> 32:14.598
- [male shopper] I hear
he's being investigated.

32:16.827 --> 32:17.842
Can't believe he wants
to show his face here.

32:17.995 --> 32:19.269
- [female shopper]
absolutely disgusting.

32:19.421 --> 32:20.938
- [male shopper]
let's get outta here.

32:21.165 --> 32:22.847
- [female shopper]
I'm with you on that.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.442
(tense music)

32:37.439 --> 32:38.956
- Still planning
on making dinner?

32:42.110 --> 32:43.585
Did you make it to the store?

32:45.022 --> 32:47.297
- People are never gonna
let me forget, are they?

32:53.138 --> 32:54.196
- What happened?

32:54.214 --> 32:55.880
- Nothing.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.048
Nothing happened.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.383
I don't even know if
it was real or not,

32:58.535 --> 33:00.811
Or just in my head.

33:06.210 --> 33:07.818
They moved out because
of me, didn't they?

33:09.989 --> 33:10.821
- Let's just say that

33:13.717 --> 33:15.492
Kyle and I have our
differences, that's all.

33:16.978 --> 33:18.570
- I didn't kill her dog.

33:18.722 --> 33:19.663
- I know you didn't.

33:23.318 --> 33:26.003
- But you still felt it
necessary to check my laundry?

33:26.154 --> 33:28.413
- Because you said
you were guilty, so.

33:28.565 --> 33:31.082
- Because I let her out
into the front yard.

33:31.235 --> 33:35.070
- Jacob, I get half truths
from you all the time

33:35.088 --> 33:37.681
And I try to talk to you,
but you shut me out, so.

33:38.909 --> 33:40.851
- Am I being investigated
for ayden's death?

33:42.746 --> 33:43.745
I'm not a little boy anymore.

33:43.838 --> 33:44.980
You don't need to protect me.

33:50.270 --> 33:54.013
- The police exhumed ayden's
body today to do an autopsy.

33:54.107 --> 33:57.367
(tense music continues)

34:03.283 --> 34:05.208
- Can I be alone, please?

34:07.938 --> 34:09.362
- Yeah.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.172
Yeah.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.209
(knocking on door)

34:23.228 --> 34:24.135
- Oh!

34:24.229 --> 34:25.562
Okay, I'm coming!

34:27.791 --> 34:29.140
Now's not really a good time.

34:29.293 --> 34:30.550
- I need to have a
conversation with your son

34:30.644 --> 34:31.735
About ayden's death.

34:31.886 --> 34:33.737
- No, you've talked
to him enough already.

34:33.888 --> 34:35.054
- Well then I'll
have to arrest him

34:35.074 --> 34:36.907
For the murder of ayden.

34:37.058 --> 34:38.075
- I hope you're kidding.

34:40.913 --> 34:41.986
- It's okay, mom.

34:42.081 --> 34:42.913
I'll talk to him.

34:43.990 --> 34:45.749
- Do not say a word to him.

34:46.977 --> 34:47.876
- I got it.

34:58.171 --> 34:59.579
- Something weighing on you?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.557
- Mom said not to
talk, so I'm not gonna,

35:04.161 --> 35:06.177
But I already told
you what happened.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.105
- It's funny.

35:08.256 --> 35:09.922
The autopsy tells us
a different story.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.666
- That can't be true.

35:11.685 --> 35:13.335
It's like I've already said.

35:13.353 --> 35:14.945
- Why don't you
just tell me again?

35:16.690 --> 35:18.281
- I saw him make it to the top,

35:18.508 --> 35:21.343
Or at least I thought
he made it there safely,

35:21.361 --> 35:22.510
And then I heard him scream

35:22.604 --> 35:24.955
And I saw him come
over the side.

35:25.182 --> 35:27.958
I was on the wall frozen
trying to process it

35:28.109 --> 35:30.685
Because it didn't
make any sense.

35:30.704 --> 35:32.704
- How long did you stay frozen?

35:32.856 --> 35:35.465
- Five seconds, five
minutes, I don't know.

35:35.617 --> 35:37.134
My first instinct
was to climb down,

35:37.361 --> 35:38.877
But then I realized it
would take too long.

35:39.029 --> 35:40.470
So I went to the top

35:40.622 --> 35:41.954
And ran down the
road for the haulers,

35:41.974 --> 35:43.974
But it didn't matter.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.476
It didn't matter.

35:46.628 --> 35:47.886
He was already dead.

35:48.038 --> 35:50.555
- The other night you
told me you climbed down.

35:50.707 --> 35:52.983
In your original statement
you said the same.

35:53.210 --> 35:54.484
- Did I?

35:54.636 --> 35:56.153
- Why would you
change your story now?

35:58.715 --> 35:59.397
Turn around.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.715
(dramatic music)

36:00.808 --> 36:01.307
- What are you doing?
- You're under arrest.

36:01.401 --> 36:02.217
I'm arresting you.

36:02.235 --> 36:03.309
- Wait, what are you doing?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.644
What are you, what
did you say to him?

36:04.663 --> 36:05.387
- [jacob] nothing.

36:05.405 --> 36:06.888
- What are you doing?

36:06.981 --> 36:08.223
- Ayden didn't
die from the fall.

36:08.241 --> 36:09.649
He was killed with a weapon

36:09.668 --> 36:10.816
And jacob here just confessed

36:10.836 --> 36:13.170
He was at the top of
the quarry that day.

36:13.321 --> 36:14.129
Get him outta here.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.675
- Jacob, is this true?

36:21.905 --> 36:22.512
- Mm-hmm.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.073
This ayden's room?

36:25.091 --> 36:26.016
- [marianne] yes.

36:26.167 --> 36:27.017
- Where's all his stuff?

36:29.521 --> 36:32.647
(garage door humming)

36:34.935 --> 36:36.267
Check everything.

36:36.420 --> 36:39.821
(police radio chattering)

36:41.441 --> 36:43.033
Check under that
box right there.

36:46.354 --> 36:49.522
- [marianne] could you
please be careful with that?

36:49.541 --> 36:50.999
That's expensive.

36:52.694 --> 36:55.045
Excuse me?
- Let me see those.

36:55.196 --> 36:57.047
- [marianne] please
put that back.

36:57.198 --> 36:58.673
- [detective
sanchez] what's that?

37:01.887 --> 37:02.886
Get a picture of that.

37:05.298 --> 37:06.056
- [marianne] that's ayden's.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.133
- Work it up.

37:09.228 --> 37:09.893
Priority one.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.138
We're also looking
for a cell phone.

37:14.233 --> 37:14.898
- Right here.

37:17.218 --> 37:18.977
- What kind of
phone did he have?

37:19.071 --> 37:21.404
We're gonna find out what
kind one way or another.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.074
So I need it now.

37:26.152 --> 37:27.410
- They both had smartphone xgs.

37:28.730 --> 37:29.746
- Let me see that phone.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.086
Bag it up.
- Okay.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.257
- We've got all
we need right now

37:42.577 --> 37:43.426
But we will be back.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.008
Grab that.

37:50.160 --> 37:50.725
Let's go.

37:52.012 --> 37:53.511
Let's grab those two. Let's go.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.588
(dramatic music)

37:55.607 --> 37:56.347
- [bailiff] all rise.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.181
(gavel bangs)

37:57.276 --> 37:57.899
Court dismissed.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.352
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:01.505 --> 38:02.353
Hey, did I-

38:02.447 --> 38:03.613
- Miss it?

38:03.840 --> 38:04.355
Yeah.

38:04.508 --> 38:05.673
- So what happened?

38:06.601 --> 38:09.027
- Well, luckily the judge
was able to grant bail.

38:09.179 --> 38:10.345
- For a murder case?

38:10.363 --> 38:12.013
- He's on house arrest.

38:12.106 --> 38:13.623
He has to wear an ankle monitor.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.941
They're not just gonna
let him walk around

38:15.961 --> 38:17.352
And I had to put up the house.

38:17.445 --> 38:19.296
- Is kyle gonna
be okay with him?

38:19.447 --> 38:22.040
- He and camilla aren't
staying there right now.

38:22.192 --> 38:24.116
- So you're gonna be
alone there with jacob?

38:24.136 --> 38:25.543
- Yes.

38:25.695 --> 38:26.786
- And you think that's safe?

38:26.805 --> 38:30.532
- What makes you so
certain that he's guilty?

38:30.625 --> 38:32.717
- Why are you so
certain he's not?

38:32.869 --> 38:36.037
- He's the only son I have left.

38:36.056 --> 38:37.963
- And he's the reason for that.

38:37.983 --> 38:38.815
(hand slaps)
(marianne grunts)

38:38.966 --> 38:41.151
(tense music)

38:49.052 --> 38:50.994
If you want me to come
stay with you, I will.

38:52.906 --> 38:53.830
All you have to do is ask.

39:00.564 --> 39:02.154
- He's unbelievable.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.064
I mean, why would he say that?

39:03.083 --> 39:05.157
Why would he even think that?

39:05.177 --> 39:08.086
- He just sees the
whole thing differently.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.420
- Differently?

39:09.514 --> 39:12.349
He honestly believes that
jacob killed his brother.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.092
He didn't.

39:14.244 --> 39:15.334
He couldn't.

39:15.354 --> 39:18.480
(gentle somber music)

39:27.032 --> 39:28.656
(phone vibrating)

39:31.036 --> 39:31.851
Hello?

39:31.945 --> 39:33.703
- Hi, this is dr. Steinman

39:33.930 --> 39:36.097
From the west side
animal hospital.

39:36.190 --> 39:37.874
- Hi.
- Yeah, I was just calling

39:38.101 --> 39:41.694
To let you know that
princess' ashes are here

39:41.788 --> 39:42.879
And ready to be picked up.

39:43.030 --> 39:45.623
- Oh, could you please
call kyle for that?

39:45.717 --> 39:46.716
- Oh, I'm sorry.

39:47.944 --> 39:49.886
This is the number
that was left.

39:51.038 --> 39:51.963
- You know what?

39:52.115 --> 39:54.039
Actually I'll come
by in the morning

39:54.059 --> 39:55.558
And pick them up.

39:55.710 --> 39:57.285
Quick question though.

39:57.303 --> 39:59.378
Do you know what
happened to her?

39:59.398 --> 40:01.380
- It looks like a wild animal.

40:01.474 --> 40:03.141
The bite marks and trauma

40:03.293 --> 40:06.051
Are consistent with
cases I've seen before.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.963
- And are you pretty
sure about that?

40:08.982 --> 40:10.240
- I'm pretty positive, yeah.

40:10.467 --> 40:11.966
Why?

40:12.059 --> 40:13.559
- Nothing. Thank you so much.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.227
I will see you in the morning.

40:15.247 --> 40:17.229
- Oh, sounds good.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.039
- Bye.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.261
(marianne grunts)

40:34.933 --> 40:37.434
(marianne sighs)

40:38.770 --> 40:41.604
(soft tense music)

40:49.781 --> 40:51.005
To my sweet one.

40:51.098 --> 40:53.766
I dream of the day we
can truly be together.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.343
I watch you in the field,

40:55.436 --> 40:57.528
Your hair glistening in the sun.

40:57.681 --> 40:58.788
You drive me crazy.

41:02.352 --> 41:05.444
I want you to take me
in your big, strong arms

41:05.538 --> 41:07.964
And never let me go.

41:08.191 --> 41:09.615
Xo.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.618
You look so hot in that uniform.

41:12.637 --> 41:13.636
I will always be your

41:16.975 --> 41:18.549
Naughty girl.

41:18.702 --> 41:20.810
To my handsome man, xo.

41:25.725 --> 41:26.483
- Well, it just depends

41:26.634 --> 41:28.151
On if we want to give them that.

41:28.378 --> 41:28.985
Right.

41:30.547 --> 41:31.321
Well...

41:32.824 --> 41:34.716
Hey, could I actually call
you back in like 10 minutes?

41:34.734 --> 41:35.825
I just had a client walk in.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.162
Thanks. Okay.

41:41.891 --> 41:43.407
- I'm a client now?

41:43.560 --> 41:44.501
- No, look,

41:47.897 --> 41:52.133
This whole thing is
crazy and complicated.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.677
I'm sorry, I didn't...

41:56.848 --> 41:58.163
- How's camilla?

41:58.258 --> 41:59.015
- Nights are hard.

42:00.076 --> 42:01.425
She's having these nightmares

42:01.520 --> 42:03.427
About princess and...

42:03.580 --> 42:04.187
Is that her?

42:05.265 --> 42:05.980
- Yeah.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.417
It was a wild animal.

42:09.435 --> 42:11.510
Jacob didn't hurt princess.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.087
- She's still gonna blame him

42:13.106 --> 42:14.939
For letting her out that night.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.257
(gentle music)

42:16.350 --> 42:18.701
- So are you still at the hotel?

42:18.928 --> 42:20.537
- No.

42:20.764 --> 42:24.265
Look, I don't see how
we can move back in

42:24.284 --> 42:26.543
Until this whole thing
with jacob gets resolved.

42:28.029 --> 42:29.879
- It's probably
gonna be a while.

42:31.274 --> 42:32.790
- Yeah.

42:32.884 --> 42:33.550
I don't like it.

42:35.036 --> 42:36.219
She's my daughter.

42:36.370 --> 42:38.388
I mean, she's gotta be my
first priority, you know?

42:39.282 --> 42:40.965
- And jacob is mine.

42:41.117 --> 42:41.724
- Yeah.

42:43.970 --> 42:45.061
- Okay.
- Yeah.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.356
Hey, wait, wait.

42:54.147 --> 42:55.405
Look, I saw a future in us.

42:56.408 --> 42:57.073
All of us.

42:59.077 --> 42:59.742
- Me too.

43:02.488 --> 43:06.082
This really sucks. (giggles)
- yeah. (laughs)

43:06.309 --> 43:06.916
Yeah.

43:17.153 --> 43:19.262
- So when you find
something more permanent,

43:19.489 --> 43:22.840
Just call and you can
come get your stuff.

43:22.992 --> 43:23.600
- Okay.

43:23.751 --> 43:26.936
(gentle music continues)

43:33.336 --> 43:34.352
- [chris] jacob, you
should have called me back.

43:34.504 --> 43:35.670
- [jacob] you shouldn't
have come over.

43:35.688 --> 43:36.520
- Why won't you let me help?

43:36.673 --> 43:38.072
- Just go, man. Get outta here.

43:40.844 --> 43:41.859
- Hi.

43:41.953 --> 43:42.844
Can I help you?

43:42.862 --> 43:44.028
- Ms. Davis, I'm chris taylor.

43:44.122 --> 43:44.954
I go to school,

43:46.532 --> 43:47.773
Went to school with jacob.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.274
- You shouldn't be here, mom.

43:49.294 --> 43:50.442
- Well, I'm clear about that,

43:50.462 --> 43:52.687
But I am curious why you are.

43:52.705 --> 43:53.537
- I feel like everything
that's happening

43:53.632 --> 43:55.131
Is because of me.

43:55.282 --> 43:57.783
- Do you wanna get
kicked outta school too?

43:57.802 --> 43:59.636
- What are you talking about?

43:59.787 --> 44:01.212
- You didn't tell her?

44:01.306 --> 44:03.047
- Tell me what?

44:03.199 --> 44:05.642
- Jacob wasn't the one
burning the cheat sheets.

44:05.793 --> 44:06.643
It was me.

44:06.794 --> 44:09.145
(soft tense music)

44:09.296 --> 44:11.130
- What are you doing?

44:11.224 --> 44:12.315
- Burning my cheat sheets.

44:13.376 --> 44:14.984
I should have never cheated.

44:15.136 --> 44:15.968
It was stupid.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.320
- You were desperate.

44:17.471 --> 44:18.713
It's okay.

44:18.731 --> 44:21.732
We all do stupid stuff
when we're desperate.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.050
Someone's coming.

44:23.144 --> 44:24.494
- [commander greg] all
right, who's back here

44:24.645 --> 44:25.328
Burning something?

44:27.832 --> 44:28.498
- Don't worry.

44:29.575 --> 44:31.058
I got this.

44:31.077 --> 44:33.911
- Thank you so much for coming
here and telling me this.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.246
- I wanna help.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.081
I know he couldn't have
done what they're saying.

44:37.233 --> 44:38.566
- But what happened at school

44:38.584 --> 44:41.160
Has nothing to do with what
happened to my brother.

44:41.179 --> 44:43.404
So no reason to get
kicked out on my account.

44:43.423 --> 44:45.998
- But jacob, don't you
see this is a good thing?

44:46.017 --> 44:48.017
People need to start seeing
you in a more positive light.

44:48.244 --> 44:50.019
And if chris becomes
a character witness,

44:50.246 --> 44:52.855
Then it's only gonna
make your case stronger.

44:53.007 --> 44:54.916
Especially if this goes
on record with the school.

44:54.934 --> 44:55.858
- I'm gonna do it

44:57.845 --> 44:58.820
And you can't stop me.

45:01.591 --> 45:02.198
Okay.

45:03.109 --> 45:04.592
- Thank you.

45:04.610 --> 45:08.037
(soft tense music continues)

45:18.124 --> 45:19.941
- Mom, I really wish
we didn't just do that.

45:19.959 --> 45:22.126
- And to think for a second

45:22.220 --> 45:25.037
I thought you would apologize
for lying to me again.

45:25.056 --> 45:26.297
- Lying?

45:26.391 --> 45:27.965
I protected him.

45:28.117 --> 45:30.284
- Jacob, it is always
a half truth with you.

45:30.303 --> 45:32.878
I mean, why would
you not tell me that?

45:32.897 --> 45:34.638
I could have argued
your case to them.

45:34.733 --> 45:35.973
- They wanted to dump me

45:36.125 --> 45:37.716
And you didn't seem like
you wanted to talk to me

45:37.736 --> 45:39.402
At that point either.

45:39.629 --> 45:41.220
So I kept my mouth
shut to get back here

45:41.239 --> 45:42.238
And show you that
I'm not the screw up

45:42.389 --> 45:43.406
Everyone thinks I am.

45:43.557 --> 45:46.225
- I do not think that
you're a screw up.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.152
- That's right. I'm a killer.

45:48.246 --> 45:49.245
- Don't say that.

45:52.325 --> 45:54.917
And why would you think taking
the blame was a good idea?

45:56.980 --> 45:57.545
- No reason.

45:58.648 --> 45:59.255
- No reason.

46:00.650 --> 46:01.591
Awesome.

46:01.818 --> 46:03.926
Do you know that feels
like a lie to me?

46:04.078 --> 46:06.912
- I don't care
what it feels like.

46:06.931 --> 46:07.722
- God.

46:11.010 --> 46:13.344
Jacob, I want to believe,

46:13.438 --> 46:14.678
I wanna trust,

46:14.831 --> 46:16.421
I want to do everything
in my power to help you.

46:16.441 --> 46:18.257
But if you lie to me,

46:18.276 --> 46:19.350
I can't trust you.

46:19.502 --> 46:20.518
- You can trust me.

46:20.612 --> 46:23.095
- But you said you didn't
make it to the top.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.615
- I didn't kill ayden.

46:25.842 --> 46:28.117
And I'm tired of everyone
thinking that I did.

46:29.512 --> 46:30.936
Even you.

46:31.030 --> 46:33.122
I didn't do what
they said I did.

46:33.349 --> 46:35.958
I lied because I was
16 and I was scared

46:36.110 --> 46:38.035
And I already knew what
people thought of me.

46:38.187 --> 46:40.704
So I thought that if I
didn't make it to the top,

46:40.857 --> 46:42.873
People wouldn't blame
me for ayden's death.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.358
It was stupid.

46:44.451 --> 46:45.802
But why would you
believe me now?

46:45.953 --> 46:46.803
You didn't before.

46:48.548 --> 46:50.047
That's why you sent me away.

46:50.199 --> 46:52.475
- No, jacob, no, that is
not why I sent you away.

46:52.626 --> 46:54.626
I don't even know
why I sent you away

46:54.720 --> 46:56.813
And I owe you an apology.

46:56.964 --> 46:58.981
I am so sorry.

46:59.133 --> 47:00.891
We never should have shipped
you off to that school

47:01.044 --> 47:03.561
And I should have never let
you be sent to that school.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.321
- But dad, right?

47:06.899 --> 47:07.824
- He was in pain.

47:08.051 --> 47:11.569
- I was your son
too. I was in pain!

47:11.721 --> 47:12.328
Me... !

47:13.723 --> 47:14.330
...Me.

47:15.667 --> 47:16.666
- I'm so sorry.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.169
I'm so sorry.

47:21.397 --> 47:24.173
I am not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.067
I am not gonna let
anybody ship you away

47:26.085 --> 47:28.845
And I am going to do everything
in my power to save you.

47:31.332 --> 47:33.741
- [nathan] we would've
been great that season.

47:33.759 --> 47:34.851
His back, my arm.

47:36.837 --> 47:38.688
You still haven't told me
why you're here though.

47:40.249 --> 47:42.007
- I need your help.

47:42.026 --> 47:42.766
- Anything. Yeah.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.193
You know that.

47:44.420 --> 47:46.195
- I need to know if anyone
had a grudge against ayden,

47:46.347 --> 47:48.680
Especially if they were
on the baseball team.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.941
- I mean, everyone
I know loved ayden,

47:51.094 --> 47:52.034
The whole team, the school.

47:53.037 --> 47:53.828
He wasn't a bully.

47:55.039 --> 47:56.873
He was a class favorite.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.190
I mean, yeah, there's
not a single person

47:58.209 --> 47:59.834
I would know that'd have
anything against him.

48:01.771 --> 48:02.786
Except one.

48:02.881 --> 48:05.773
Look, mrs. Davis, I know
why you're here, I do.

48:05.791 --> 48:09.051
But I saw jacob follow ayden
around like he was god.

48:09.278 --> 48:11.036
- So then you know
he couldn't do it.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.796
- Yeah, but at times
he would go crazy

48:12.891 --> 48:13.964
When he lost to ayden.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.057
It doesn't matter if
it was video games,

48:15.209 --> 48:17.894
Ro-sham-bo or, you
know, thumb wars.

48:18.121 --> 48:19.120
I don't know, ayden
cast a pretty big shadow

48:19.213 --> 48:21.472
That jacob just couldn't
seem to get past.

48:21.624 --> 48:23.065
So, I mean,

48:23.217 --> 48:24.049
I think in the
heat of the moment,

48:24.068 --> 48:25.217
Losing to his brother

48:25.311 --> 48:26.310
Could have caused him
the lash out again.

48:26.462 --> 48:27.645
I do.

48:27.739 --> 48:28.571
I'm sorry.

48:29.632 --> 48:31.815
- The police think ayden
was killed with a bat.

48:31.968 --> 48:32.650
- I'm sorry, a bat?

48:32.744 --> 48:33.910
So-
- yeah.

48:34.061 --> 48:34.985
- [nathan] not the fall.

48:35.138 --> 48:36.061
- Yes, that means the bat

48:36.080 --> 48:37.246
Had to be at the
top to start with.

48:37.473 --> 48:39.582
And neither of the boys
carried it up with them.

48:39.809 --> 48:42.067
Besides, that would
be premeditated,

48:42.161 --> 48:43.586
Not heat of the moment.

48:45.089 --> 48:49.383
Look, I know that jacob
lied about a lot of things,

48:50.820 --> 48:52.428
But he is not a killer.

48:52.655 --> 48:55.598
So I just need for
you to think about it.

48:55.825 --> 48:57.491
Anybody you know who had
a problem with ayden,

48:57.510 --> 48:59.009
Just let me know, that's it?

48:59.162 --> 48:59.677
- Yeah.

48:59.829 --> 49:01.604
Yeah, I'll do that.

49:01.831 --> 49:02.846
- Great.

49:02.999 --> 49:03.922
- All right.

49:03.942 --> 49:05.424
Should I walk you out?

49:05.518 --> 49:06.567
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

49:10.856 --> 49:11.522
So I'll keep thinking about it,

49:11.674 --> 49:13.783
But I'll figure it out.

49:15.011 --> 49:15.843
Yeah.

49:15.861 --> 49:17.119
- I appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

49:17.271 --> 49:18.913
- Hi, mrs. Davis.
- Hey, stephanie.

49:20.032 --> 49:21.791
You might wanna
swing by the house.

49:22.018 --> 49:23.626
I found this letter
that you wrote ayden,

49:23.777 --> 49:26.687
A love letter and it was,
it was kind of graphic.

49:26.706 --> 49:28.038
I thought you might want it.

49:28.191 --> 49:28.872
- Wait.

49:29.025 --> 49:29.948
Love letter?

49:29.968 --> 49:31.968
I never wrote ayden
a love letter,

49:32.953 --> 49:34.971
Especially one that
might be graphic.

49:35.198 --> 49:36.288
- Oh.

49:36.307 --> 49:37.381
- He was cheating on me.

49:37.475 --> 49:38.215
- No, no, no.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.216
He was not cheating on you.

49:39.310 --> 49:40.384
- God, I knew it.

49:40.478 --> 49:41.644
- You knew it?

49:42.796 --> 49:44.129
- Things have changed.

49:44.223 --> 49:46.131
There's a possibility that
somebody else killed ayden.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.559
So, if you know of
anything just, you know.

49:48.711 --> 49:50.711
- I never actually knew it.

49:50.730 --> 49:51.988
I didn't have any evidence.

49:53.216 --> 49:55.065
The last few days
before ayden died,

49:55.218 --> 49:57.142
He was just so different.

49:57.161 --> 49:59.829
He was being secretive
and it made me paranoid.

50:00.814 --> 50:02.573
- Why didn't you say anything?

50:02.725 --> 50:04.834
- The last time I saw him
we got into a huge fight.

50:06.078 --> 50:07.895
He caught me looking
through his phone

50:07.988 --> 50:09.839
And he flew off the handle on me

50:09.990 --> 50:11.340
Even though I didn't
find anything.

50:13.678 --> 50:17.179
My last memories of being
with him are just so ugly.

50:18.332 --> 50:19.181
- I am so sorry.

50:20.409 --> 50:22.518
Maybe the letter came
from someone else,

50:22.669 --> 50:24.336
Someone before you, older.

50:25.414 --> 50:27.915
But I do know that ayden
did not cheat on you.

50:27.933 --> 50:29.099
I know that.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.267
- Okay.

50:30.419 --> 50:31.418
- Okay?

50:31.437 --> 50:32.153
- Okay.

50:34.515 --> 50:36.273
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Drive safe.

50:36.367 --> 50:38.868
(tense music)

50:45.117 --> 50:47.001
(gentle mysterious music)

50:53.534 --> 50:55.301
- [jacob] mom,
what are you doing?

50:57.704 --> 50:59.847
- Just going through the past.

51:01.708 --> 51:04.226
- Do you need any
help with anything?

51:05.730 --> 51:06.711
- Did you ever see ayden

51:06.806 --> 51:08.230
With another girl
besides stephanie?

51:08.382 --> 51:10.066
- No. Why?

51:10.293 --> 51:14.052
- Because this fell out
of one of his yearbooks

51:14.072 --> 51:15.963
And stephanie thinks
that he was cheating.

51:16.056 --> 51:18.557
So I'm just going
through the yearbook

51:18.651 --> 51:19.967
And trying to match handwriting

51:20.060 --> 51:22.536
And see if I can find a
secret crush or something.

51:24.140 --> 51:26.565
- He always seemed
so into steph.

51:26.659 --> 51:27.732
They had gotten into a fight

51:27.752 --> 51:28.918
The day we went to the quarry,

51:29.069 --> 51:32.329
But usually he seemed
pretty happy with her.

51:32.481 --> 51:35.316
- And the fight was about

51:35.334 --> 51:37.651
Her going through his
text messages, right?

51:37.670 --> 51:38.427
- Yeah.

51:38.654 --> 51:40.003
- Have you seen his cell phone?

51:40.098 --> 51:41.263
- Not after that day.

51:43.008 --> 51:43.933
- Here.

51:44.160 --> 51:44.767
Thanks.

51:47.939 --> 51:50.164
- [jacob] okay, if there's
nothing I can help with,

51:50.182 --> 51:51.440
I'm gonna go watch a movie.

51:53.502 --> 51:54.110
- Hey, you.

51:54.261 --> 51:56.779
So, how's jacob?

51:56.930 --> 51:58.763
(marianne sighs)

51:58.858 --> 52:00.932
- I hope that we
turned a corner.

52:00.952 --> 52:02.192
I feel like I've been so busy

52:02.286 --> 52:03.360
Trying to prove his innocence,

52:03.512 --> 52:06.697
That I'm afraid that
I'm gonna destroy

52:06.791 --> 52:07.957
My memories of ayden.

52:09.852 --> 52:10.459
- How so?

52:12.521 --> 52:13.129
- Thank you.

52:14.023 --> 52:17.207
Well, I found this letter

52:17.301 --> 52:18.467
That someone wrote ayden

52:18.619 --> 52:21.620
And it's a love letter
and it's kind of graphic.

52:21.714 --> 52:23.380
Anyways, I approached
steph about it

52:23.474 --> 52:25.808
And she didn't write it.

52:25.959 --> 52:27.810
So now she's convinced that
ayden was cheating on her

52:28.037 --> 52:30.037
And it's basically destroyed
her memories of him

52:30.130 --> 52:33.056
And I'm afraid that
if I keep digging,

52:33.209 --> 52:35.467
I'm gonna do the same
thing for myself.

52:35.561 --> 52:37.653
- No, it won't, not with ayden.

52:37.880 --> 52:38.445
No way.

52:42.067 --> 52:42.825
- Well, you were
around both families

52:42.976 --> 52:44.809
When you were dating nick.

52:44.904 --> 52:45.977
Am I crazy to think

52:46.071 --> 52:47.830
That maybe he really
was cheating on her?

52:48.908 --> 52:51.816
- Yes, absolutely nuts.

52:51.836 --> 52:53.076
Okay?

52:53.171 --> 52:54.837
Ayden was a great kid.

52:55.731 --> 52:57.339
He was a well adjusted,

52:57.491 --> 52:58.582
Handsome young man

52:58.734 --> 52:59.750
Who was gonna be somebody

52:59.844 --> 53:01.844
That you and daniel
could always be proud of.

53:03.239 --> 53:05.681
He didn't deserve
what happened to him,

53:05.832 --> 53:08.976
Whether it was an accident
or something uglier.

53:10.246 --> 53:11.169
- Thank you.

53:11.189 --> 53:12.262
- Oh.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.247
(glasses clinking)

53:13.265 --> 53:15.599
- Thank you for your support.

53:15.693 --> 53:16.859
Jacob and I are gonna need it.

53:18.938 --> 53:21.864
- Well, I can be there for you,

53:23.108 --> 53:25.201
But I can't be there for jacob.

53:25.428 --> 53:28.037
- What are you,
what are you saying?

53:28.188 --> 53:30.355
- You really need me to
list all the reasons?

53:30.374 --> 53:31.932
The funeral reception,

53:32.025 --> 53:34.435
Him disappearing the
first night back.

53:34.528 --> 53:36.212
I mean, even before
ayden's death

53:36.363 --> 53:39.790
There were times he made me
feel really uncomfortable.

53:39.942 --> 53:40.716
- What do you mean?

53:41.961 --> 53:44.445
- I've caught him staring at me

53:44.463 --> 53:45.870
And I always thought, you know,

53:45.890 --> 53:48.206
It was just him being a young
boy coming into his own,

53:48.226 --> 53:51.468
But I mean, there was one time
he followed me into a store.

53:52.379 --> 53:55.397
- Tara, teenagers
go shopping too.

53:55.549 --> 53:57.233
- At maxie's?

53:57.460 --> 53:59.476
It's not exactly your
typical teen hangout.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.462
- Okay, what'd he say?

54:01.555 --> 54:04.131
- That he was getting a
birthday present for you

54:04.224 --> 54:06.575
And it was nowhere
near your birthday.

54:06.802 --> 54:08.893
Did he ever give you this
present from maxie's?

54:08.988 --> 54:10.871
- I don't remember.

54:12.083 --> 54:12.831
- I think you do.

54:14.085 --> 54:16.643
- Why didn't you ever
say anything before?

54:16.662 --> 54:17.828
- Well, I was going to,

54:17.980 --> 54:21.590
But then ayden died and
you sent jacob away.

54:21.817 --> 54:24.260
So it just seemed like a
non-issue at that point.

54:24.411 --> 54:26.487
But now, until I know more

54:26.580 --> 54:27.930
About what happened
at the quarry,

54:29.008 --> 54:31.100
Please don't ask me to
put my faith in jacob.

54:32.419 --> 54:33.936
I just can't.

54:34.087 --> 54:35.920
- If you can't put
your faith in jacob,

54:36.015 --> 54:37.856
Then you don't have
any faith in me.

54:40.002 --> 54:40.759
None.

54:40.778 --> 54:41.944
- Marianne.
- I'm leaving.

54:42.171 --> 54:43.261
- Marianne.

54:43.281 --> 54:44.280
Come on.

54:46.175 --> 54:48.534
(tara sighs)

54:50.179 --> 54:53.938
(phone keyboard clicking)

54:53.958 --> 54:54.790
- Hey.

54:55.851 --> 54:57.684
- You had a late
night last night.

54:57.778 --> 54:59.536
I heard you come
in after midnight.

54:59.688 --> 55:01.130
- I was over at tara's.

55:01.281 --> 55:03.299
- Oh, tara's.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.117
Why were you there?

55:06.211 --> 55:09.046
- Just talking about things.

55:09.198 --> 55:10.973
- Did she ask about me?

55:11.200 --> 55:12.624
- Your name came up.

55:12.718 --> 55:13.976
- What did she say?

55:14.203 --> 55:15.552
- What do you mean?

55:15.704 --> 55:19.389
- I don't know, is she like
team guilty or team not guilty?

55:19.483 --> 55:20.816
- Jacob, it's not funny.

55:22.486 --> 55:24.394
I wish you would take
this more seriously.

55:24.547 --> 55:26.046
- So, what did she say?

55:26.065 --> 55:27.972
- I don't want to get
into it right now.

55:28.067 --> 55:30.233
- I think I have
a right to know.

55:30.328 --> 55:31.810
Can you please just sit down?

55:31.829 --> 55:33.329
Tell me.

55:33.556 --> 55:34.163
- Okay.

55:34.314 --> 55:36.999
(gentle music)

55:38.002 --> 55:41.728
Apparently before
everything happened,

55:41.747 --> 55:44.340
She said that you made
her feel uncomfortable

55:44.567 --> 55:46.491
And that you
followed her around.

55:46.510 --> 55:47.676
Did you?

55:47.903 --> 55:49.403
- No.

55:49.421 --> 55:50.754
- So you didn't follow
her into maxie's?

55:50.906 --> 55:51.847
- I never did that.

55:51.998 --> 55:54.016
That's a lie. She's lying.

55:54.243 --> 55:56.977
- Then tell me why would she
make up such a specific lie?

55:58.597 --> 55:59.930
You don't know?
- Mm-mm.

56:00.024 --> 56:02.524
- Look, it's okay if you had
a school boy crush on her.

56:02.676 --> 56:03.359
You can tell me.

56:03.586 --> 56:05.361
- I never had a crush on tara.

56:05.588 --> 56:06.195
- Okay.

56:09.925 --> 56:11.091
- Hey, mom?

56:11.110 --> 56:12.275
- Yeah.

56:12.370 --> 56:14.036
- Thanks for all this.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.207
I love you.

56:19.710 --> 56:20.376
- I love you too.

56:29.887 --> 56:32.679
(soft tense music)

56:36.468 --> 56:38.285
She said you made her
feel uncomfortable

56:38.378 --> 56:39.878
And that you
followed her around.

56:39.897 --> 56:40.879
Did you?

56:40.898 --> 56:41.980
- No.

56:43.142 --> 56:44.458
I didn't follow her.

56:44.551 --> 56:45.308
- [marianne] so you didn't
follow her into maxie's?

56:45.461 --> 56:47.310
- [jacob] I never did that.

56:47.405 --> 56:48.145
I never did any of that.

56:48.297 --> 56:49.655
That's a lie. She's lying.

56:50.799 --> 56:51.573
- Then tell me why
she would make up

56:51.800 --> 56:52.816
Such a specific lie.

56:52.968 --> 56:53.867
Why?

56:56.914 --> 57:00.565
Jacob, it's okay if you had
a school boy crush on her.

57:00.584 --> 57:03.168
(dramatic music)

57:05.906 --> 57:06.755
(doorbell rings)

57:06.907 --> 57:08.882
- Jacob, can you get that?

57:10.928 --> 57:11.718
Jacob!

57:13.079 --> 57:15.172
(knocking on door)

57:15.266 --> 57:18.016
(doorbell ringing)

57:18.919 --> 57:20.269
Thanks for nothing, jacob.

57:22.106 --> 57:24.014
(knocking on door)

57:24.108 --> 57:24.773
What are you doing here?

57:24.925 --> 57:25.774
- Where's jacob?

57:25.926 --> 57:26.591
- In his room.

57:26.610 --> 57:28.110
- You sure?
- Yeah.

57:28.261 --> 57:30.854
- Because we got a notice his
ankle monitor alarm went off.

57:31.006 --> 57:32.448
- Well, he's in his room.

57:32.675 --> 57:33.690
So...

57:33.842 --> 57:34.933
- Jacob.
- Excuse me?

57:34.952 --> 57:35.784
- Jacob.

57:37.012 --> 57:38.102
I didn't invite you

57:38.197 --> 57:38.603
Into my house.
- It's called probable cause,

57:38.697 --> 57:39.529
Mrs. Davis.

57:39.623 --> 57:40.864
Which room is jacob's?
- Jacob!

57:40.958 --> 57:41.865
- [marianne] it's right here.

57:42.017 --> 57:46.962
(monitor beeping)
(dramatic music)

57:49.967 --> 57:51.467
- Yeah, he's gone.

57:53.286 --> 57:55.804
(tense music)

57:58.367 --> 58:00.383
- Jacob, what are you doing?

58:00.478 --> 58:01.768
- Why are you lying about me?

58:07.151 --> 58:07.983
(tense music)

58:11.155 --> 58:12.637
- Can you please sit?

58:12.731 --> 58:14.472
- Can you please leave?

58:14.492 --> 58:16.975
I don't even know
why you're here.

58:17.069 --> 58:18.142
- He asked me to be here.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.811
I'd rather be anywhere
else, trust me.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.571
(phone chiming)
(phone vibrating)

58:21.724 --> 58:22.498
- Put it on speaker.

58:24.168 --> 58:24.833
- It's my friend.

58:26.395 --> 58:27.503
Hey, tara...

58:27.654 --> 58:29.062
- [nurse] mrs. Davis,
this is the floor nurse

58:29.081 --> 58:31.398
At valley hospital calling
regarding your friend tara.

58:31.416 --> 58:33.250
- [marianne] what happened?

58:33.344 --> 58:35.252
- [nurse] apparently jacob
attacked her at her house.

58:35.346 --> 58:38.421
She's in recovery now and
wanted us to notify you.

58:38.574 --> 58:41.183
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

58:43.187 --> 58:45.336
- Where do you
think you're going?

58:45.356 --> 58:47.022
- To the hospital.

58:47.173 --> 58:48.506
My friend just got
admitted to the er.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.008
- Okay, well we'll
have somebody take you.

58:50.102 --> 58:51.084
- That's not necessary.

58:51.177 --> 58:52.361
- No, you're hiding something.

58:53.531 --> 58:54.196
- What is it?

58:56.258 --> 58:58.108
What is it?

58:58.260 --> 59:00.610
- Jacob broke into tara's
house and beat her up.

59:00.763 --> 59:01.703
- Jesus.

59:01.855 --> 59:03.430
- And you were gonna
keep that from us?

59:03.448 --> 59:04.373
- I just wanted to find out

59:04.524 --> 59:05.690
The whole story
first, that's all.

59:05.709 --> 59:06.691
- Well I wanna find out
the whole story too.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.043
- [marianne] okay,
then let's go.

59:11.440 --> 59:14.032
Oh my god.
- It's okay. I'm okay.

59:14.126 --> 59:14.883
- What happened, ma'am?

59:17.221 --> 59:17.886
- It was jacob.

59:19.782 --> 59:20.722
He broke into my house.

59:22.226 --> 59:23.350
He was so upset.

59:24.728 --> 59:26.303
I've seen him mad before,
but this was different.

59:26.397 --> 59:27.896
This was rage.

59:29.474 --> 59:30.957
- Why would he attack you?

59:30.976 --> 59:34.570
- He was afraid I was trying
to turn his mother against him.

59:34.797 --> 59:36.296
- [tara] jacob, what
are you doing here?

59:36.389 --> 59:37.739
- Why are you lying about me?

59:39.243 --> 59:40.242
She was on my side

59:40.393 --> 59:41.893
Until you opened
your big fat mouth.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.970
- Jacob, you're acting crazy.

59:43.989 --> 59:44.821
(tara yelp)

59:44.915 --> 59:45.822
Let go of me!

59:45.974 --> 59:48.250
(hand slaps)

59:50.087 --> 59:53.088
(tara grunts)

59:53.315 --> 59:53.755
I must have blacked
out for a few minutes.

59:56.318 --> 59:57.593
When I woke up, he was gone.

59:59.655 --> 1:00:01.096
- Any idea where
he might have gone?

1:00:03.008 --> 1:00:04.658
I'm gonna put
somebody at your door

1:00:04.676 --> 1:00:06.584
And at your house
once you're released.

1:00:06.604 --> 1:00:08.829
- He won't come back.

1:00:08.847 --> 1:00:09.896
He did what he needed to do.

1:00:11.516 --> 1:00:12.833
I'd just be more concerned

1:00:12.851 --> 1:00:14.943
With anybody else that he
might have a grudge with.

1:00:16.447 --> 1:00:17.446
- I am so sorry.

1:00:21.267 --> 1:00:22.117
Do you want me to go?

1:00:23.954 --> 1:00:26.747
(soft tense music)

1:00:34.206 --> 1:00:36.590
(tara sighs)

1:00:40.971 --> 1:00:41.711
(dramatic music)

1:00:41.805 --> 1:00:42.471
- [jacob] don't!

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:45.974
- Go ahead, son.

1:00:47.703 --> 1:00:48.310
Do it.

1:00:49.647 --> 1:00:50.646
You've already destroyed

1:00:50.873 --> 1:00:52.314
Everything I care
about in this life.

1:00:53.651 --> 1:00:56.485
- Will you ever believe
that I didn't kill ayden?

1:00:58.155 --> 1:00:59.470
- You can take me
out of this world,

1:00:59.490 --> 1:01:01.806
But there is one
incontrovertible truth

1:01:01.900 --> 1:01:03.492
That I know to be a fact.

1:01:04.995 --> 1:01:07.737
Ayden isn't here because of you.

1:01:07.890 --> 1:01:10.666
(suspenseful music)

1:01:12.169 --> 1:01:14.670
(jacob grunts)

1:01:17.733 --> 1:01:18.915
(door slams)

1:01:19.009 --> 1:01:21.234
(daniel screams)

1:01:21.253 --> 1:01:25.013
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:01:39.363 --> 1:01:41.846
(wood creaking)

1:01:41.865 --> 1:01:43.532
- Is someone here?

1:01:43.759 --> 1:01:44.366
Jacob!

1:01:45.536 --> 1:01:46.201
Jacob!

1:01:54.044 --> 1:01:55.877
Oh, jacob. Thank god.

1:01:56.939 --> 1:01:58.213
What are you doing with a gun?

1:02:00.125 --> 1:02:01.216
- It can all be over, mom.

1:02:02.961 --> 1:02:03.885
It can all end.

1:02:05.889 --> 1:02:08.539
You won't have to
worry about me anymore.

1:02:08.559 --> 1:02:09.683
- Please don't say that.

1:02:11.044 --> 1:02:12.060
Give me the gun, okay?

1:02:14.289 --> 1:02:15.230
- I screwed up, mom.

1:02:16.291 --> 1:02:17.807
- I know.

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:18.808
- You know?

1:02:18.961 --> 1:02:19.884
- Yeah.

1:02:19.903 --> 1:02:20.694
Tara called me.

1:02:22.130 --> 1:02:23.480
- I'm sorry.

1:02:23.632 --> 1:02:24.889
- It's okay.

1:02:24.983 --> 1:02:26.816
Look, she's gonna be okay.

1:02:26.969 --> 1:02:27.984
She's gonna recover

1:02:28.078 --> 1:02:29.652
And the hospital's
gonna release her soon.

1:02:29.805 --> 1:02:30.412
- What?

1:02:31.582 --> 1:02:32.822
The hospital?

1:02:32.975 --> 1:02:34.583
- Jacob, give me the gun.
This isn't the answer.

1:02:34.734 --> 1:02:35.751
- What does it matter?

1:02:37.421 --> 1:02:38.754
- Please don't say that.

1:02:41.258 --> 1:02:42.048
- Sanchez is here.

1:02:43.819 --> 1:02:46.169
- Jacob, please let me
walk you out to him.

1:02:46.263 --> 1:02:48.505
I promised you that I would
be there for you 'til the end

1:02:48.599 --> 1:02:49.247
And I will be.

1:02:49.266 --> 1:02:50.673
(knocking on door)

1:02:50.768 --> 1:02:52.917
- Get rid of him.

1:02:52.936 --> 1:02:54.936
- Give me the gun.

1:02:55.088 --> 1:02:56.012
(doorbell rings - knocking)
- no.

1:02:56.164 --> 1:02:57.105
- Jacob, if I don't
open the door,

1:02:57.332 --> 1:02:59.274
He's gonna know that
something is wrong.

1:02:59.501 --> 1:03:02.426
- Just know I'm not
gonna let him take me.

1:03:02.446 --> 1:03:04.020
(more knocking - doorbell rings)

1:03:04.172 --> 1:03:05.280
- Okay.

1:03:05.507 --> 1:03:06.114
Okay.

1:03:07.117 --> 1:03:08.858
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
go get rid of him.

1:03:08.952 --> 1:03:10.601
(more knocking)

1:03:10.695 --> 1:03:12.937
Don't shoot, don't do anything,

1:03:12.956 --> 1:03:15.198
And I'm gonna get rid of him.

1:03:15.350 --> 1:03:18.126
(suspenseful music)

1:03:24.543 --> 1:03:25.133
What now?

1:03:29.047 --> 1:03:29.971
- Your ex-husband called me.

1:03:31.383 --> 1:03:32.974
Jacob made off with his weapon.

1:03:34.645 --> 1:03:37.720
So now I gotta treat him as
armed and extremely dangerous.

1:03:37.873 --> 1:03:40.707
Especially after his
assault on your friend.

1:03:40.725 --> 1:03:42.651
Has he tried to contact you?

1:03:42.878 --> 1:03:43.634
- No.

1:03:43.654 --> 1:03:45.320
If he does, I will let you know.

1:03:46.565 --> 1:03:47.805
- Also the bat,

1:03:47.825 --> 1:03:50.158
The one we found in your garage,

1:03:50.310 --> 1:03:52.994
It was inconclusive as to
being the murder weapon.

1:03:53.221 --> 1:03:56.814
- Inconclusive means
that jacob didn't do it?

1:03:56.834 --> 1:03:59.000
- Inconclusive
means inconclusive.

1:03:59.152 --> 1:04:00.168
It doesn't clear
your son of anything.

1:04:02.397 --> 1:04:04.673
But the medical examiner
estimates the barrel

1:04:04.900 --> 1:04:07.825
That fractured ayden's
skull was bigger.

1:04:07.845 --> 1:04:09.235
Your son could have
gotten another bat

1:04:09.329 --> 1:04:11.346
And one very similar
to the one we had

1:04:11.497 --> 1:04:12.255
And then tossed it.

1:04:13.425 --> 1:04:15.183
- I think that you're
looking for the wrong person.

1:04:15.410 --> 1:04:16.593
I think there's
someone else out there.

1:04:16.745 --> 1:04:18.019
- He still assaulted your friend

1:04:19.857 --> 1:04:21.672
And I need to find him

1:04:21.766 --> 1:04:23.433
As soon as possible.

1:04:23.585 --> 1:04:25.694
Maybe then I can worry
about another suspect.

1:04:26.755 --> 1:04:27.604
- Okay.

1:04:27.698 --> 1:04:29.865
(tense music)

1:04:33.019 --> 1:04:34.202
(suspenseful music)

1:04:34.429 --> 1:04:35.778
Jacob.

1:04:35.931 --> 1:04:36.538
Jacob.

1:04:39.601 --> 1:04:40.208
Jacob!

1:04:41.436 --> 1:04:42.043
Jacob.

1:04:43.622 --> 1:04:44.838
Oh, jacob.

1:04:48.886 --> 1:04:52.012
(gentle somber music)

1:04:54.057 --> 1:04:55.557
- I didn't have to do that
this last season though.

1:04:55.708 --> 1:04:57.634
I mean, kind of
passed him the torch.

1:04:57.786 --> 1:05:00.120
- You didn't pass him the torch.

1:05:00.138 --> 1:05:00.970
He just got better than you.

1:05:01.064 --> 1:05:02.022
- Shut up, steph.

1:05:03.308 --> 1:05:04.858
Such a girlfriend thing to say,

1:05:06.069 --> 1:05:08.570
(tense music)

1:05:13.485 --> 1:05:13.909
Mrs. Davis.

1:05:15.561 --> 1:05:17.820
You should've
called, but come in.

1:05:17.973 --> 1:05:18.580
- Thank you.

1:05:23.069 --> 1:05:26.146
- So, can I get you anything?

1:05:26.239 --> 1:05:28.331
- Coffee if you have
some made already.

1:05:28.483 --> 1:05:29.573
- Yeah.

1:05:29.593 --> 1:05:30.592
Yeah.
- Thanks.

1:05:31.428 --> 1:05:32.761
- I want you to know, I,

1:05:32.912 --> 1:05:36.097
I haven't forgotten what
you said the other day.

1:05:36.324 --> 1:05:38.433
I really wanna help
solve ayden's death

1:05:38.660 --> 1:05:40.326
And I'm sorry I haven't
gotten those names

1:05:40.345 --> 1:05:41.102
Over to you yet.
- Yeah, no problem.

1:05:41.329 --> 1:05:43.346
- I've just been brainstorming.

1:05:43.498 --> 1:05:45.014
It takes a bit to
remember everybody's names

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:46.424
And, you know, where they
went after high school,

1:05:46.443 --> 1:05:48.092
But I'm working on it.

1:05:48.111 --> 1:05:49.427
- [marianne] yeah.

1:05:49.521 --> 1:05:50.853
- Stephanie is as well.

1:05:51.006 --> 1:05:52.188
- [marianne] great.

1:05:52.340 --> 1:05:53.097
- [nathan] I'm sure we'll
come up with a good list.

1:05:53.116 --> 1:05:53.615
- [marianne] anything will help.

1:05:56.511 --> 1:05:58.936
- We're gonna make
it a priority, so.

1:05:59.030 --> 1:06:00.271
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

1:06:00.365 --> 1:06:01.790
Let's go outside.
- Okay.

1:06:04.944 --> 1:06:05.794
Thank you.

1:06:10.968 --> 1:06:12.692
Wow. What's all this?

1:06:12.711 --> 1:06:13.617
- Coach asked me to help mentor

1:06:13.712 --> 1:06:14.803
Some of the younger guys.

1:06:15.955 --> 1:06:18.122
Not nearly as good
as we were though.

1:06:18.141 --> 1:06:20.049
And won't ever be.

1:06:20.202 --> 1:06:20.867
- Yeah.

1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:22.126
I don't mean to be a pain,

1:06:22.145 --> 1:06:24.037
But could I please get
some cream and sugar?

1:06:24.055 --> 1:06:25.146
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

1:06:30.153 --> 1:06:31.820
(tense music)

1:06:37.828 --> 1:06:38.827
Oops.

1:06:40.313 --> 1:06:40.996
Clumsy me.

1:06:42.332 --> 1:06:43.164
- What are you doing?

1:06:44.484 --> 1:06:47.002
- I was just looking
through your bats.

1:06:47.153 --> 1:06:48.336
It's quite a collection.

1:06:48.488 --> 1:06:49.487
But I didn't see the one

1:06:49.506 --> 1:06:50.672
That was in the
picture at my house.

1:06:50.899 --> 1:06:53.675
You know, the one that
you used in high school?

1:06:53.826 --> 1:06:54.417
- Yeah, I don't have it.

1:06:54.511 --> 1:06:56.252
It was stolen.

1:06:56.404 --> 1:06:57.086
- Really?

1:06:58.164 --> 1:06:59.663
Are there a lot of bat
thieves running around?

1:06:59.683 --> 1:07:00.923
- I mean, it wasn't just stolen.

1:07:01.018 --> 1:07:05.762
It was actually taken
just around ayden's death.

1:07:05.914 --> 1:07:07.171
- Well that's weird.

1:07:07.265 --> 1:07:08.915
Did you report it missing?

1:07:08.933 --> 1:07:10.083
- A stolen bat?

1:07:10.101 --> 1:07:10.767
- Yeah.

1:07:10.861 --> 1:07:11.918
- To the police?

1:07:11.936 --> 1:07:13.586
- Yeah.

1:07:13.679 --> 1:07:15.513
- What are you
really doing here?

1:07:15.532 --> 1:07:17.681
You weren't just stopping by.

1:07:17.701 --> 1:07:19.442
- Ayden was killed with a bat,

1:07:19.594 --> 1:07:21.594
One that was bigger than his,

1:07:21.613 --> 1:07:23.687
And you always used a
bigger bat than ayden.

1:07:23.707 --> 1:07:24.447
- Me?

1:07:24.599 --> 1:07:25.281
- Yeah.

1:07:25.433 --> 1:07:26.541
- You think I killed ayden?

1:07:27.878 --> 1:07:29.952
Mrs davis, I know you're
desperate for an answer,

1:07:30.047 --> 1:07:32.789
And you want it to be anybody
else except for jacob,

1:07:32.941 --> 1:07:35.108
But what makes you think
that I would kill ayden?

1:07:35.126 --> 1:07:35.842
- Jealousy.

1:07:37.054 --> 1:07:38.035
You were the star of the team

1:07:38.129 --> 1:07:38.887
And then he comes along

1:07:39.038 --> 1:07:40.129
And he becomes better than you

1:07:40.223 --> 1:07:41.948
And then he's the star
and you don't like it

1:07:42.041 --> 1:07:43.633
'cause it's not gonna change.

1:07:43.785 --> 1:07:46.544
- Yeah, he was better than me

1:07:46.563 --> 1:07:47.729
And the coaches knew it,

1:07:48.732 --> 1:07:50.381
The team knew it.

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:52.383
It doesn't mean I'd kill him.

1:07:52.477 --> 1:07:53.401
Going to state with ayden

1:07:53.628 --> 1:07:54.235
Meant more to me
than being the star

1:07:54.462 --> 1:07:55.737
And you gotta realize that.

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:58.981
I loved that kid like a brother.

1:07:59.134 --> 1:07:59.982
- But you knew he was gonna be

1:08:00.077 --> 1:08:00.909
At the quarry that
day, didn't you?

1:08:01.136 --> 1:08:02.302
- I'm not keeping
tabs on the guy.

1:08:02.395 --> 1:08:04.470
I mean, what do you
think, I'm his girlfriend?

1:08:04.489 --> 1:08:05.413
- Hey, you two.

1:08:08.234 --> 1:08:09.209
What's with the looks?

1:08:11.479 --> 1:08:12.312
- You.

1:08:12.330 --> 1:08:13.313
- Me what?

1:08:13.331 --> 1:08:14.163
- No way.

1:08:14.257 --> 1:08:15.239
- No way what?

1:08:15.258 --> 1:08:16.999
- This was you.

1:08:17.152 --> 1:08:18.985
- Ms. Davis, why are you
looking at me like that?

1:08:19.078 --> 1:08:19.910
- She thinks you killed ayden.

1:08:19.930 --> 1:08:21.154
- You were in a fight

1:08:21.172 --> 1:08:22.913
And you thought that
he was cheating on you

1:08:22.933 --> 1:08:24.081
And you went through his phone

1:08:24.101 --> 1:08:25.992
And you could not
find any proof of it.

1:08:26.085 --> 1:08:27.510
But I bet you saw
the text messages

1:08:27.662 --> 1:08:29.771
That they were gonna be at the
quarry that day, didn't you?

1:08:29.922 --> 1:08:32.999
So, so you stole
your brother's bat

1:08:33.092 --> 1:08:34.758
And then you went
to swing at him

1:08:34.778 --> 1:08:35.685
Just to show him how
serious you were.

1:08:35.837 --> 1:08:36.519
Maybe you didn't
mean to kill him,

1:08:36.671 --> 1:08:37.779
But you swung at him

1:08:38.006 --> 1:08:40.523
And you hit him in the
head and you killed ayden!

1:08:40.617 --> 1:08:43.009
- I did know that they were
gonna be there that day,

1:08:43.102 --> 1:08:45.178
But I didn't follow or show up

1:08:45.196 --> 1:08:46.788
And I definitely
didn't kill him.

1:08:47.624 --> 1:08:49.031
You wanna know
what I did instead?

1:08:49.184 --> 1:08:50.016
- Yes, I do.

1:08:50.034 --> 1:08:51.275
- I locked myself in my room

1:08:51.294 --> 1:08:53.870
Deciding whether or not
to break up with him.

1:08:53.964 --> 1:08:54.945
And I decided to.

1:08:54.965 --> 1:08:55.964
I decided to end things.

1:08:58.026 --> 1:08:59.208
And then I got the
call that he had died

1:08:59.302 --> 1:09:02.953
And felt like I had wished
his death into existence,

1:09:03.047 --> 1:09:04.864
But I wasn't at the quarry

1:09:04.883 --> 1:09:06.883
And I definitely didn't
hit him with a bat.

1:09:08.052 --> 1:09:11.128
So instead of standing there
pointing fingers at me,

1:09:11.148 --> 1:09:13.648
Why aren't you
looking for that girl?

1:09:13.875 --> 1:09:15.375
You know, the one
that wrote the letter?

1:09:15.393 --> 1:09:17.226
Why aren't you looking for her?

1:09:17.379 --> 1:09:19.970
- Because there's
no names on there

1:09:19.990 --> 1:09:22.991
And I have been trying
to match the handwriting

1:09:23.218 --> 1:09:25.142
To the yearbooks and
I can't find a match.

1:09:25.236 --> 1:09:26.235
- So, there's no names?

1:09:26.329 --> 1:09:27.662
- [marianne] no.

1:09:27.813 --> 1:09:29.313
- Obviously they were trying
to keep things a secret.

1:09:29.332 --> 1:09:31.240
- Okay, but the baseball bat,

1:09:31.393 --> 1:09:32.892
The missing baseball bat
cannot be a coincidence.

1:09:32.911 --> 1:09:34.169
It can't be.

1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:36.004
- I'll ask my dad.
I'll ask tara.

1:09:36.231 --> 1:09:37.397
I'll ask the coaches.
I'll ask the team.

1:09:37.415 --> 1:09:38.581
- Tara?

1:09:38.675 --> 1:09:39.399
- Yeah, tara.

1:09:39.492 --> 1:09:41.250
My dad's ex-girlfriend.

1:09:41.344 --> 1:09:42.177
(dramatic music)

1:09:42.328 --> 1:09:43.160
I mean, I'm sure if I asked him

1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:44.587
I must have asked her.

1:09:44.681 --> 1:09:45.513
- And besides,

1:09:45.740 --> 1:09:47.423
Who even writes a
fricking letter?

1:09:47.575 --> 1:09:48.975
I mean even like two years ago?

1:09:50.169 --> 1:09:52.187
That's something someone
your age would do.

1:09:53.190 --> 1:09:54.672
(tense music)

1:09:54.691 --> 1:09:55.648
- Is everything okay?

1:09:58.177 --> 1:09:59.602
- Can I have that
letter back please?

1:09:59.754 --> 1:10:00.361
- Yeah.

1:10:02.774 --> 1:10:04.590
- I am so sorry, you guys.

1:10:04.609 --> 1:10:07.260
I am so sorry for accusing you,

1:10:07.278 --> 1:10:08.328
But I have to go.

1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:10.596
- [nathan] where are you going?

1:10:10.615 --> 1:10:12.040
- To see one of my friends.

1:10:15.045 --> 1:10:17.787
(sirens wailing)

1:10:17.939 --> 1:10:20.715
(suspenseful music)

1:10:25.797 --> 1:10:27.847
(car beeps)

1:10:31.394 --> 1:10:32.635
- Jacob?

1:10:32.729 --> 1:10:34.229
Oh my god.

1:10:34.456 --> 1:10:35.063
- Drive.

1:10:53.157 --> 1:10:55.658
- [marianne] oh my god.

1:10:55.752 --> 1:10:56.918
Is that jacob?

1:10:58.146 --> 1:10:59.921
What are they doing?

1:11:00.072 --> 1:11:01.589
Where are they going?

1:11:04.335 --> 1:11:07.428
(suspenseful music)

1:11:07.580 --> 1:11:09.171
- They'll tell me
how sorry they are

1:11:09.324 --> 1:11:11.099
But behind my back,

1:11:11.326 --> 1:11:12.916
They'll just blame
me for ayden's death.

1:11:13.011 --> 1:11:14.418
- Nobody blames you.

1:11:14.512 --> 1:11:15.770
- They think I killed him.

1:11:18.166 --> 1:11:20.090
- [detective sanchez]
your son's lying.

1:11:20.110 --> 1:11:21.501
- [marianne] about what?

1:11:21.594 --> 1:11:23.019
- [detective sanchez] about
your other son's death.

1:11:23.947 --> 1:11:26.172
- What makes you so
certain that he's guilty?

1:11:26.265 --> 1:11:27.949
- Why are you so
certain he's not?

1:11:30.512 --> 1:11:32.011
- [marianne] I mean, he was
a month away from graduation

1:11:32.104 --> 1:11:33.937
And something must
have happened.

1:11:33.957 --> 1:11:36.440
- [daniel] yeah, he happened.

1:11:36.459 --> 1:11:37.417
It's what he does.

1:11:38.853 --> 1:11:40.962
- [marianne] he's the
only son I have left.

1:11:41.947 --> 1:11:43.856
- And he's the reason for that.

1:11:43.949 --> 1:11:45.041
(hand slaps)
(marianne grunts)

1:11:45.193 --> 1:11:45.967
- [detective sanchez]
so now I gotta treat him

1:11:46.194 --> 1:11:48.210
As armed and
extremely dangerous.

1:11:48.305 --> 1:11:51.139
- [marianne] do you know
that feels like a lie to me.

1:11:51.290 --> 1:11:52.974
- I don't care
what it feels like.

1:11:55.036 --> 1:11:56.052
- Ayden didn't
die from the fall.

1:11:56.146 --> 1:11:59.055
He was killed with a
weapon and jacob here

1:11:59.207 --> 1:12:01.965
Just confessed he was at the
top of the quarry that day.

1:12:01.985 --> 1:12:02.984
- Jacob, is this true?

1:12:03.135 --> 1:12:03.818
Is this true?
(echoes in her head)

1:12:06.047 --> 1:12:06.654
Come on.

1:12:08.550 --> 1:12:09.157
Hurry up!

1:12:10.552 --> 1:12:11.492
I'm gonna lose them!

1:12:17.817 --> 1:12:20.001
(tara grunting)
(dramatic music)

1:12:20.152 --> 1:12:20.984
- [tara] where
are you taking me?

1:12:21.004 --> 1:12:22.003
- [jacob] shut up.

1:12:23.006 --> 1:12:25.231
- [marianne] come on.

1:12:25.249 --> 1:12:26.466
Where are they?

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:36.976
(dramatic music)

1:12:39.522 --> 1:12:40.855
Jacob!

1:12:41.006 --> 1:12:41.856
- Stop struggling.
- Jacob, ow!

1:12:42.007 --> 1:12:42.598
- [jacob] don't
make me hurt you.

1:12:42.750 --> 1:12:43.691
- You're hurting me!

1:12:43.918 --> 1:12:45.193
Let go!
- Move.

1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:46.844
- Jacob!

1:12:46.863 --> 1:12:47.612
Jacob.

1:12:48.773 --> 1:12:51.440
I do not think that
you're a screw up.

1:12:51.534 --> 1:12:53.016
- That's right. I'm a killer.

1:12:53.111 --> 1:12:55.203
I'm a killer. I'm a killer.

1:12:56.598 --> 1:12:58.931
- Jacob!

1:12:59.024 --> 1:13:00.357
- Just keep moving,
do you understand?

1:13:00.377 --> 1:13:02.693
- Jacob, I don't wanna
go up there, please.

1:13:03.955 --> 1:13:06.029
- [marianne] but if you lie
to me, I can't trust you.

1:13:06.124 --> 1:13:07.215
- [jacob] you can trust me.

1:13:07.366 --> 1:13:09.125
- You said you didn't
make it to the top.

1:13:09.219 --> 1:13:11.535
- I didn't kill ayden

1:13:11.554 --> 1:13:14.113
And I'm tired of everyone
thinking that I did.

1:13:14.132 --> 1:13:14.947
- [tara] jacob, please.

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:16.540
Why are you doing this to me?

1:13:16.634 --> 1:13:18.951
- [jacob] I think you know why.

1:13:19.044 --> 1:13:20.210
- [marianne] let me walk
you out to him right now.

1:13:20.304 --> 1:13:21.378
Jacob, if I don't open the door

1:13:21.472 --> 1:13:23.731
He's gonna know that
something is wrong.

1:13:23.958 --> 1:13:26.475
- Just know I'm not
gonna let him take me.

1:13:26.569 --> 1:13:27.793
I'm not gonna let him take me.

1:13:27.887 --> 1:13:29.553
I'm not gonna let him take me.

1:13:29.572 --> 1:13:30.963
- Jacob!

1:13:30.982 --> 1:13:32.073
- Marianne, help!

1:13:32.909 --> 1:13:33.816
Help!

1:13:33.968 --> 1:13:35.058
Help, please! Somebody help me!

1:13:35.078 --> 1:13:36.244
I'm over here!

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:39.305
- [marianne] I am not gonna
let anybody ship you away

1:13:39.323 --> 1:13:42.583
And I am going to do everything
in my power to save you.

1:13:42.810 --> 1:13:44.234
- Admit it.

1:13:44.254 --> 1:13:46.754
- How am I supposed to admit
something I didn't do, jacob?

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:49.757
- Jacob?

1:13:49.984 --> 1:13:50.925
Jacob.

1:13:51.986 --> 1:13:55.004
- Marianne, please,
please talk to your son.

1:13:55.098 --> 1:13:56.489
- You shouldn't be here.

1:13:56.582 --> 1:13:57.748
- Jacob, you don't
have to do this.

1:13:57.842 --> 1:13:59.675
- You don't know
what she's done.

1:13:59.769 --> 1:14:01.084
- I know what she did.

1:14:01.179 --> 1:14:03.771
She killed ayden because
she was sleeping with him.

1:14:03.998 --> 1:14:04.939
- What?

1:14:05.925 --> 1:14:07.775
I didn't do that. That's a lie.

1:14:08.002 --> 1:14:08.776
- Are you telling me

1:14:10.688 --> 1:14:11.946
That you didn't write this?

1:14:13.450 --> 1:14:15.265
- What are you talking about?

1:14:15.285 --> 1:14:17.359
- You were my friend.

1:14:17.454 --> 1:14:19.028
- Tell her what you did.

1:14:19.122 --> 1:14:20.455
- Jacob, please don't.

1:14:20.606 --> 1:14:21.456
You don't have to do this.

1:14:21.607 --> 1:14:22.682
You don't have to
become somebody

1:14:22.775 --> 1:14:23.607
That everybody thinks
you already are.

1:14:23.701 --> 1:14:25.201
You can walk away from this

1:14:25.295 --> 1:14:27.295
And you can still have a life.

1:14:27.522 --> 1:14:28.129
Please.

1:14:29.373 --> 1:14:31.299
- But I'm responsible
for ayden's death.

1:14:32.469 --> 1:14:34.302
I'm fixing my mistake.

1:14:34.453 --> 1:14:35.636
- You heard him.

1:14:35.863 --> 1:14:36.696
He just admitted it.

1:14:36.789 --> 1:14:38.047
He just said that
he's responsible

1:14:38.199 --> 1:14:40.808
And he's just trying to
cover it up by blaming me.

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.643
- You used me.

1:14:42.870 --> 1:14:43.869
- What?

1:14:43.888 --> 1:14:44.386
- Used?

1:14:44.481 --> 1:14:45.313
How'd she use you?

1:14:46.149 --> 1:14:47.482
- That letter you wrote.

1:14:49.060 --> 1:14:49.984
It wasn't to ayden.

1:14:52.805 --> 1:14:53.488
It was to me.

1:14:54.549 --> 1:14:55.156
- To you?

1:14:56.993 --> 1:14:59.568
To my 16 year old son?

1:14:59.721 --> 1:15:01.496
- No, he's, he's lying.

1:15:01.723 --> 1:15:02.571
He's a liar.

1:15:02.665 --> 1:15:03.739
He's always been a liar.

1:15:03.891 --> 1:15:05.482
I never-
(gun clicks)

1:15:05.576 --> 1:15:06.792
- Ayden found out about us.

1:15:08.505 --> 1:15:09.578
- Look at what I found

1:15:09.731 --> 1:15:11.506
In my little brother's
room yesterday.

1:15:13.843 --> 1:15:15.993
His own homemade
personal erotica.

1:15:16.012 --> 1:15:18.429
(ayden laughs)

1:15:20.241 --> 1:15:21.574
Oh, man.

1:15:21.667 --> 1:15:24.018
I can't believe my little
bro is finally getting some.

1:15:25.671 --> 1:15:28.097
- [tara] jacob! (giggling)

1:15:28.249 --> 1:15:30.007
- He thinks I'm at
dinner with stephanie

1:15:30.026 --> 1:15:31.859
And that he'll have
the house to himself.

1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:44.539
- [tara] that feels so good.

1:15:47.693 --> 1:15:50.044
(tara moaning)

1:15:55.367 --> 1:15:57.960
- He threatened to show
the video to you and dad.

1:15:58.054 --> 1:15:59.612
I didn't want that

1:15:59.705 --> 1:16:01.222
And tara definitely
didn't want that.

1:16:03.801 --> 1:16:04.967
- Jacob, this isn't good.

1:16:05.061 --> 1:16:07.044
How could you let this happen?

1:16:07.138 --> 1:16:09.063
- I didn't know he
was gonna be home.

1:16:09.290 --> 1:16:11.399
I thought he'd be at
dinner with his girlfriend.

1:16:12.569 --> 1:16:13.959
- That's okay.

1:16:13.978 --> 1:16:16.070
I have an idea.

1:16:16.297 --> 1:16:17.646
- It was her idea for
me to challenge ayden

1:16:17.799 --> 1:16:19.465
To climb the rock face.

1:16:19.558 --> 1:16:20.891
A race to the top
with the bet being

1:16:20.910 --> 1:16:24.394
That when I won, he'd
have to keep our secret.

1:16:24.488 --> 1:16:26.897
She knew we would be there.

1:16:26.916 --> 1:16:28.874
She made me believe
that I could beat him.

1:16:30.086 --> 1:16:32.402
I believed it so much
that I only realized

1:16:32.496 --> 1:16:34.755
That she set him
up when she lied

1:16:34.982 --> 1:16:36.424
About me beating
her up in her home.

1:16:38.169 --> 1:16:39.427
I never put a hand on you.

1:16:42.432 --> 1:16:43.598
- What are you gonna do?

1:16:49.105 --> 1:16:51.421
I knew you weren't man enough.

1:16:51.515 --> 1:16:53.666
- I've done everything
to protect you

1:16:53.759 --> 1:16:55.592
And you tell my
mom I stalked you?

1:16:55.612 --> 1:16:56.360
- Jacob.

1:16:57.947 --> 1:16:59.429
Come on.

1:16:59.449 --> 1:17:01.115
Don't you see?

1:17:01.342 --> 1:17:04.869
If I'm not in your corner
that gives us cover.

1:17:06.013 --> 1:17:06.871
I love you.

1:17:07.865 --> 1:17:10.699
And you love me too, right?

1:17:10.793 --> 1:17:13.044
I mean you promised me you're
always gonna protect me.

1:17:14.797 --> 1:17:15.630
Jacob.

1:17:16.949 --> 1:17:18.299
Come here.

1:17:18.450 --> 1:17:20.617
(tense music)

1:17:20.637 --> 1:17:22.119
Jacob.

1:17:22.138 --> 1:17:22.970
Jacob.

1:17:26.959 --> 1:17:27.975
- And because of that lie,

1:17:28.202 --> 1:17:32.388
I realized she never
believed in me at all.

1:17:32.540 --> 1:17:33.797
She counted on the fact

1:17:33.816 --> 1:17:35.941
That I would lose
and lose badly.

1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:38.653
She needed me to lose.

1:17:40.047 --> 1:17:41.489
- I'm not quitting.

1:17:42.717 --> 1:17:43.824
- Fine.

1:17:44.051 --> 1:17:44.825
See you at the top.

1:17:47.405 --> 1:17:49.238
- [jacob] she stole
the bat from nathan

1:17:49.332 --> 1:17:50.331
And waited at the top.

1:17:53.227 --> 1:17:54.985
- [ayden] boy,
it's nice up here.

1:17:55.004 --> 1:17:55.911
What happened to all
that big talk down there?

1:17:56.005 --> 1:17:57.062
- Shut up.
- You stop for lunch?

1:17:57.081 --> 1:17:59.415
- [jacob] do you
ever stop talking?

1:17:59.509 --> 1:18:00.841
- [ayden] not this time.

1:18:01.068 --> 1:18:02.993
Don't worry, we'll find
something you can beat me in.

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:03.752
(ayden laughs)

1:18:03.905 --> 1:18:04.403
(bat thuds)

1:18:04.422 --> 1:18:07.348
(ayden screaming)

1:18:09.852 --> 1:18:12.770
(dramatic music)

1:18:18.085 --> 1:18:19.268
- And she counted on my
guilt to keep me quiet.

1:18:19.362 --> 1:18:20.920
She was right.

1:18:20.938 --> 1:18:24.773
- I shared my life with you
and this is what you do?

1:18:24.867 --> 1:18:27.535
You sleep with my son and
you kill the other one.

1:18:27.762 --> 1:18:30.095
- Marianne, come on.

1:18:30.189 --> 1:18:32.373
You can't possibly
believe all that.

1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:36.101
This is just some fairy
tale that he's made up.

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:38.879
You really think I would
sleep with your son?

1:18:39.106 --> 1:18:41.623
This is just some
delusion that he's made up

1:18:41.718 --> 1:18:44.868
Because I rejected his advances.

1:18:44.887 --> 1:18:46.721
Okay, I knew he
had a crush on me,

1:18:46.872 --> 1:18:51.208
But I didn't know it would
turn into this crazy obsession.

1:18:51.227 --> 1:18:54.395
And nice, jacob, victim blaming.

1:18:54.622 --> 1:18:56.789
It wasn't enough
that you beat me up.

1:18:56.882 --> 1:18:58.640
You have to make up
this elaborate lie

1:18:58.735 --> 1:19:00.550
To try and discredit me.

1:19:00.570 --> 1:19:01.736
- That letter you wrote.

1:19:02.905 --> 1:19:04.071
- The letter.

1:19:04.298 --> 1:19:06.907
Good luck trying to
prove that that was me.

1:19:07.134 --> 1:19:09.468
Are there, are there
names, are there dates?

1:19:09.561 --> 1:19:11.971
You think handwriting is
gonna hold up in court?

1:19:11.989 --> 1:19:13.563
- You're right.

1:19:13.657 --> 1:19:15.207
Maybe they won't
believe the letter,

1:19:16.994 --> 1:19:18.002
But they'll believe this.

1:19:19.146 --> 1:19:21.238
(suspenseful music)

1:19:21.257 --> 1:19:22.239
(dramatic music)

1:19:22.258 --> 1:19:24.741
Ayden's old phone.

1:19:24.761 --> 1:19:28.012
The one with the video of
us together for posterity.

1:19:29.915 --> 1:19:32.850
Your face is there in
all its glory close up.

1:19:34.845 --> 1:19:35.828
Hmm.

1:19:35.921 --> 1:19:37.754
Should I just play
it for my mom?

1:19:37.774 --> 1:19:38.922
- No.

1:19:38.941 --> 1:19:40.015
No, marianne, please,
please, please.

1:19:40.167 --> 1:19:41.333
You have to believe me.

1:19:41.352 --> 1:19:42.926
I didn't mean for any
this to happen, okay?

1:19:42.945 --> 1:19:44.427
I'm so sorry.

1:19:44.447 --> 1:19:45.362
- So it is true.

1:19:46.932 --> 1:19:47.948
It's all true?

1:19:49.010 --> 1:19:49.858
(tara yelps)

1:19:49.952 --> 1:19:51.101
- I'm sorry, okay.

1:19:51.195 --> 1:19:54.029
Nick and I were having problems

1:19:54.123 --> 1:19:56.698
And jacob gave me what I needed.

1:19:56.793 --> 1:19:59.018
He gave me attention.

1:19:59.036 --> 1:20:01.370
That's all I wanted
was just attention.

1:20:01.464 --> 1:20:02.463
And so at first he would just,

1:20:02.614 --> 1:20:03.798
He would just listen to me

1:20:03.949 --> 1:20:07.376
And then it just happened.

1:20:07.528 --> 1:20:09.545
- It doesn't just happen!

1:20:09.697 --> 1:20:11.880
He was a 16 year old boy!

1:20:12.033 --> 1:20:13.365
- I didn't mean for this
to happen, marianne.

1:20:13.458 --> 1:20:14.867
I'm sorry!

1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:15.935
I'm sorry!

1:20:17.629 --> 1:20:18.813
I'm sorry.

1:20:18.964 --> 1:20:21.649
(tara crying)

1:20:21.876 --> 1:20:22.441
- Get up.

1:20:25.062 --> 1:20:26.303
Get up!

1:20:26.322 --> 1:20:28.881
(dramatic music)

1:20:28.899 --> 1:20:31.450
(both grunting)

1:20:33.478 --> 1:20:35.979
(tara gasping)

1:20:36.073 --> 1:20:38.165
- Help me, help me, please!

1:20:44.173 --> 1:20:46.081
- Mom, don't.

1:20:46.175 --> 1:20:46.748
- What she did to you,

1:20:46.843 --> 1:20:48.584
You were just a boy

1:20:48.678 --> 1:20:49.735
And she killed ayden.

1:20:49.753 --> 1:20:50.427
- I know.

1:20:51.663 --> 1:20:53.848
- Please, I can't
hold on much longer!

1:20:54.075 --> 1:20:55.516
Please!

1:20:55.667 --> 1:20:56.925
- We could just walk away.

1:20:57.019 --> 1:20:57.977
We could just leave her.

1:20:58.855 --> 1:21:00.079
- No.

1:21:00.097 --> 1:21:01.413
- He's right, he's right.

1:21:01.432 --> 1:21:02.748
Help me up, help me up.

1:21:02.841 --> 1:21:03.932
- Shut up.

1:21:04.026 --> 1:21:04.766
- [tara] please, please!

1:21:04.861 --> 1:21:06.343
- Shut up!

1:21:06.362 --> 1:21:07.111
- Mom.

1:21:08.531 --> 1:21:09.780
I just needed her to admit it.

1:21:11.016 --> 1:21:11.699
She's done that.

1:21:14.019 --> 1:21:16.445
Now everyone else needs
to hear it from her too.

1:21:16.539 --> 1:21:17.854
Not just from me,

1:21:17.874 --> 1:21:19.957
Not just from you, but from her.

1:21:22.953 --> 1:21:24.879
She deserves everything
she's about to get.

1:21:27.458 --> 1:21:28.531
What would ayden do?

1:21:28.626 --> 1:21:31.201
(suspenseful music)

1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:32.111
- No.

1:21:32.204 --> 1:21:34.037
No, you were gonna let me go.

1:21:34.056 --> 1:21:36.298
Please just let me
die here, please.

1:21:36.392 --> 1:21:37.141
Let me go.

1:21:38.210 --> 1:21:39.118
(all grunting)

1:21:39.136 --> 1:21:41.120
No, you should've
just let me die!

1:21:41.213 --> 1:21:41.970
I'm sorry!

1:21:42.123 --> 1:21:43.213
(fist thuds)
(tara screams)

1:21:43.232 --> 1:21:44.023
- Mom!

1:21:46.644 --> 1:21:48.193
- I don't think ayden
would've minded that.

1:21:49.906 --> 1:21:51.630
Where did you find his phone?

1:21:51.649 --> 1:21:53.298
- Oh, this one?

1:21:53.317 --> 1:21:54.724
It's not ayden's phone.

1:21:54.744 --> 1:21:55.984
It's my old one.

1:21:56.137 --> 1:21:57.970
I don't know where his went.

1:21:58.063 --> 1:21:59.729
I needed to get her to confess

1:21:59.823 --> 1:22:01.640
And now I have it recorded.

1:22:01.733 --> 1:22:03.992
I've always been a
pretty good liar.

1:22:04.086 --> 1:22:06.069
(both chuckle)
(sirens wailing)

1:22:06.088 --> 1:22:07.755
- God, I love you. Come here.

1:22:09.926 --> 1:22:12.551
(gentle music)

1:22:16.157 --> 1:22:17.598
I'll take her to lock up.

1:22:17.825 --> 1:22:19.099
- [marianne] did I
hit her that hard?

1:22:20.436 --> 1:22:21.268
- Knocked her out.

1:22:29.111 --> 1:22:30.945
Sorry, not sorry, right?

1:22:31.172 --> 1:22:31.779
- Excuse me?

1:22:34.175 --> 1:22:34.782
- Thanks.

1:22:36.101 --> 1:22:37.117
- Why are you thanking me?

1:22:38.454 --> 1:22:41.013
I'm the one that was convinced
you killed your brother.

1:22:41.031 --> 1:22:43.849
- You were convinced
someone killed him.

1:22:43.942 --> 1:22:44.941
You were just trying
to do right by him

1:22:44.961 --> 1:22:46.627
When nobody else was.

1:22:46.854 --> 1:22:48.778
So, thanks.

1:22:49.781 --> 1:22:51.799
- You let me know if
you need anything.

1:22:52.026 --> 1:22:53.467
- Thanks.

1:22:53.618 --> 1:22:54.802
I hope I never do.

1:22:55.972 --> 1:22:56.637
- Me too, kid.

1:22:58.032 --> 1:22:58.597
Me too.

1:23:04.814 --> 1:23:05.771
- Hey.

1:23:07.041 --> 1:23:07.982
Hey.

1:23:10.987 --> 1:23:12.987
Think I might be able
to give you a ride home?

1:23:15.992 --> 1:23:16.991
- [marianne] go ahead.

1:23:19.053 --> 1:23:20.552
- Yeah, I think so.

1:23:20.571 --> 1:23:21.161
- Yeah?

1:23:27.336 --> 1:23:28.318
I'm so sorry.

1:23:28.337 --> 1:23:29.336
I'm so sorry.

1:23:30.989 --> 1:23:33.248
I'm so sorry for
doubting you, son.

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:34.842
Thank you so much
for forgiving me.

1:23:38.180 --> 1:23:41.682
(gentle music continues)

1:23:45.429 --> 1:23:49.765
(all laughing)
(dog barking)

1:23:49.917 --> 1:23:50.840
Happy birthday, son.

1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:53.861
- I love you, dad.
- I love you too.

1:23:54.088 --> 1:23:54.936
- Hey, guys.

1:23:55.031 --> 1:23:55.845
Hey, guys.

1:23:55.865 --> 1:23:56.755
Cake's ready.

1:23:56.774 --> 1:23:57.756
Come on for cake.

1:23:57.849 --> 1:23:58.924
- We get some cake?
- Cake, yes.

1:23:59.017 --> 1:24:00.092
- All right, let's do it.
- Oh, thank you.

1:24:00.185 --> 1:24:00.868
Thank you.

1:24:03.855 --> 1:24:06.373
- Yep, finally, a
dog that likes me.

1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:07.875
Thanks, mom.

1:24:08.102 --> 1:24:08.858
I love you.

1:24:08.878 --> 1:24:10.711
- [marianne] oh, I love you too.

1:24:10.862 --> 1:24:11.712
Let's have cake!

1:24:11.863 --> 1:24:14.606
