It's not voodoo.
And it's not shit!

That's Hanuman.
He's the Monkey King.

Very strong.

Yeah.

She's still freaked out
about that kid missing.

gonna squeeze it off. Hm.

Hey, she like you.

But, mm...

You don't wanna get involved
with a single mom, right?

184
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:15,416
All right, see the little

That's Dylan.

I don't know.
I've never seen them before.

Forced marriage,
crime, labor, sex.

No.

what we can get, huh?

298

They're frightened

299
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,596
Any idea who's behind all this?

300
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:26,499
No. But I heard a name.

301
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,940
Mephisto.

302
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,143

303
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:40,214
Mephisto.

304

What else did you hear?

305
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,884
I heard about the Four Horsemen,

306
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:46,220
how they plan to use
the souls of children

307
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,659
to bring about the end times.

308
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,328
Mephisto kidnaps children.

309
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:57,398
That's how the evil
grows more powerful.

310
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,800
Once the evil is strong enough,

311
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,705
they will have a ceremony
and it will end everything.

312
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:09,543
Well, that's not what
my team has determined.

Half your team is dead
because of the evil.

314
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:15,683
In order to stop the apocalypse,

315
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:18,686
one has to kill
all of the Four Horsemen.

316
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:25,993
The thing is, the Four Horsemen
look the same as everyone else.

317
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:30,297
They look like me.
They look like you.

But let's get back
to your story.

321
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:45,813
You say you saw
the Four Horsemen.

322
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:47,815
Some thought they were ghosts.

323
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:51,452
Some thought they were demons.
I knew the truth.

to the government.

I mean, it's about
protection and all,

what is it protecting us from?

You want to know what I think?

You see, those children...

I'm going to prove
that you took them.

What are you doing here?
Where's your mom?

488
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:09,290
She's waiting for some supper
from Auntie Charlotte.

489
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,461
I told her
I'm gonna talk to you.

490
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:17,532
Sure.
What you got on your mind?

491
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:22,269
Where is Dylan?
Are you going to find him?

492
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,706
I miss him.

493
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:27,341
I'm gonna find him.

494
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:36,750
I think you can protect us all.

495
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:40,187
I can barely protect myself.

496
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:43,858
But you look strong.

497
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:52,601
This body can take
a beating. I admit that.

498
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:58,472
Mister An, are you okay?

499
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:05,079
Yeah. Adults,
you know, we think too much.

500
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,647
You're a good man.

501
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,522
That's a first.

502
00:44:13,622 --> 00:44:17,725
You know, my mom always says

503
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:23,197
when you see someone,
always close your eyes.

504
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:29,303
Because you can only know
someone when you feel them.

505
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:32,306
Try it.

506

then our aim is to kill
the Night Watchman.

MASKED WOMAN: We have enough
children to start the ritual

649
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:52,479
for our essentials.
Let us begin.

650
00:56:53,648 --> 00:56:55,683
DET. RUSSELLS: So, they came
for you this time, huh?

651
00:56:55,783 --> 00:56:59,153
Why do you want to call it now?
Self-defense?

652
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:02,290
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

653
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,092
Then give me a confession.

654
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:10,598
This is the confession.

655
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:17,004
The story. The journey...

Is that where the children are?

660
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:55,576
The evil is behind the door.

661
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:59,513
The children won't be alive
much longer.

662
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:01,882
And the only way to end this

663
00:58:04,652 --> 00:58:09,156
is to give up what's left
of my soul to Hanuman.

664
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:14,261
I might have to lure them out.
It's gonna be very dangerous.

665
00:58:14,362 --> 00:58:18,232
The kids are living
on borrowed time.

666
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,101
What can we do to help?

667
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:22,636
I could save the children.

668

exactly as I say.</i>
