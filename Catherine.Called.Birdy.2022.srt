1
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,375
Morwenna!

2
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,083
Morwenna!

3
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,666
I need Morwenna!

4
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,791
Wait for me!

5
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,083
- Birdy!
- Go away, Perkin!

6
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,666
And to think I just bathed you
a fortnight ago.

7
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,666
What a waste.

8
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,916
And cottage raisings are not
for young ladies.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,958
Morwenna, I released the pigs,
and I'm not ashamed.

10
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,791
They're only headed to slaughter,
and I will not allow other animals

11
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,708
to live lives of captivity like mine.

12
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,125
You are the most well-fed captive I know.

13
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,750
And anyhow, I have a matter
far more pressing.

14
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,541
Perkin has told me how babies are made,

15
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,708
and I'm afraid I shall perish
with revulsion.

16
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,083
Well, you had to learn sooner or later.

17
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,541
You're 14.

18
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:11,125
Morwenna, am I to move on calmly
with what I know now?

19
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,416
A man is going to take
a heated iron poker... a heated one...

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,750
Stick it up my nose until there's a space
big enough for his whole thumb,

21
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,250
after which he will press seeds
into my brain.

22
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,416
And they trickle down my throat,
into my gut,

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,541
where they take root for nine months
before popping out my bum.

24
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,750
No.

25
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,083
No...

26
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,750
I shall murder Perkin.

27
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,458
I shall murder him, Morwenna!

28
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:41,791
And he will bleed worse
than if I was to stick a spike up his...

29
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,416
<i>Corpus bones!</i>

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,458
<i>It is I, Birdy.</i>

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,416
<i>I am the daughter of Lord Rollo...</i>

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,041
<i>...and the Lady Aislinn.</i>

33
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,625
<i>Charge of Morwenna, the nursemaid.</i>

34
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,083
<i>Sister to Edward the Monk...</i>

35
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,916
<i>...and to the abominable Robert.</i>

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,708
Birdy, leave me be, please.

37
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,541
- You're a courgette.
- Okay.

38
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,583
<i>Of the village of Stone bridge
in the shire of Lincoln</i>

39
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,166
<i>in the country of England
in the hands of God.</i>

40
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,583
Put your clothes on; don't refuse

41
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,333
Breeches, gloves, and also shoes;

42
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,000
Hat on head, for rain or sun

43
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,833
Buttons... do up every one.

44
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,208
<i>And friend of Perkin, my heart's brother.</i>

45
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>Although he is just a goat boy,
he is kind of heart and wise of spirit.</i>

46
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,041
<i>Though he is sorely afflicted
with wind in his bowels.</i>

47
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,708
That's it.

48
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,458
Och.

49
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,791
<i>Tangled my spinning again.</i>

50
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,625
<i>- What a torture.</i>
- No, gently.

51
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,833
<i>I would rather be fed to a stroppy dragon
than try and spin like a lady.</i>

52
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,916
Oh, come on. Like I showed you.

53
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,375
No!

54
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,916
- There.
- No.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,166
<i>I am, thank the Lord, very cunning.</i>

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,958
<i>Most girls are,
though we're not given due credit for it.</i>

57
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,875
<i>But I have a fantastic update.</i>

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,583
<i>I have made a bargain with my mother.</i>

59
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,208
<i>I may forgo spinning,
my greatest agitation of all,</i>

60
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,125
<i>as long as I write this account of my days
for my brother, Edward the Monk.</i>

61
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,666
<i>In his letters, he tells me
he believes it will help me grow</i>

62
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,166
<i>less childish and more learned.</i>

63
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,333
<i>So what follows will be my book,</i>

64
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,583
<i>the book of Catherine,
called Little Bird or Birdy.</i>

65
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,291
A golden braid for my golden lady?

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,541
<i>Meg the dairymaid is a dear friend,</i>

67
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,750
<i>when I can stop her from curtsying
and milady-ing me.</i>

68
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,125
This is hay.

69
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,166
But I really appreciate the sentiment.

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
It's beautiful.

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,750
Which means "my father is a beast,"

72
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,833
which must be the best words
that I've ever learned.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,500
You're so lucky your father's dead.

74
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,333
- Birdy.
- Hmm?

75
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:09,166
I'm still actually quite upset about that.

76
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,375
<i>My truest passions
are avoiding my chores...</i>

77
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,875
Come on, yes!

78
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,250
Fight me harder this time.

79
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,833
Not too hard, though. Not too hard.

80
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,875
<i>...critiquing my father's
horrible swordplay...</i>

81
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,500
Birdy, mind my flowers!
No, no, no, don't trample them.

82
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,041
Birdy, walk on the path.
Can you walk on the path!

83
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,708
I don't see a path.

84
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,375
<i>...disrupting cottage raisings...</i>

85
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,833
- Hey!
<i>- ...causing mischief in the village...</i>

86
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,250
You stole my chicken!

87
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,166
<i>...and listening through doors
I should not listen through.</i>

88
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,583
Well, how has this happened, Finneas?

89
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,250
After all, you're paid
to prevent things like this.

90
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,333
In essence, my lord,

91
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,250
you have ignored me.

92
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,750
You have spent profligately
and without censure.

93
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,458
Nonsense. I can't have spent so much.

94
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,125
Give me one example of-of an expense

95
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,916
not strictly necessary
for the survival of my family.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,916
Really?

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,916
My tiger has arrived.

98
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,791
It's dead.

99
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,000
The travel was harsh
from Siberia, my lord.

100
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,875
Mayhap it's just sleeping, Father.

101
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,416
It's not breathing, you fool.

102
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,375
- Perhaps some water?
<i>- What, am I to live on</i>

103
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,083
bread and water and chitchat alone,
like some peasant? Is that what you want?

104
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,583
Hey! Dog!

105
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,333
Dog.

106
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,666
Dog. Dog!

107
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,208
If, my lord, you were able to secure

108
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,750
a profitable union
for your only daughter...

109
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,125
A profitable union?

110
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,916
There is an opportunity to relieve
this accumulated debt.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,208
For Birdy?

112
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,416
- Yes.
- With a man?

113
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,208
- Yes.
- No, no.

114
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,625
No, she's disgusting.
She's one step away from... from a leper.

115
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,708
No. Go away.

116
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,000
You may not have coins,
but your wife has a title,

117
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,708
and she gave it to you...

118
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,083
She didn't give it to me.

119
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,416
I earned it.

120
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,166
There are plenty of men foolish enough

121
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,041
to trade their fortune
for the prefix of "lord."

122
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,416
Now it's your job to find one.

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,541
No, surely, there must be
another way, yes?

124
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,291
She's my only daughter.

125
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,833
And this is your only manor.

126
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,750
My lord.

127
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,208
<i>Something is astir.</i>

128
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,416
Hi.

129
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,333
<i>I can feel my father's eyes
following me wherever I go.</i>

130
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,166
<i>He is regarding me as he would
a bull bought for breeding.</i>

131
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,416
Exactly how old are you?

132
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,375
I have 14 years.

133
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,208
<i>I am surprised he's not asked
to examine my hooves.</i>

134
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,916
And you've all your own teeth?

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,208
All but one.

136
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,666
Well, you're certainly a good eater.

137
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,125
What color's your hair when it's clean?

138
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,916
When it's clean?

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,666
Blue, I think.

140
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,333
Very good.

141
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,708
Well, nice to see you.

142
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,708
Mm. And you.

143
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,208
You can go and see your little
goat friend, uh...

144
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,458
<i>What is brewing here?</i>

145
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,916
14. That's-that's not young.

146
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,708
I am dying. It is plain to see.

147
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:04,041
What's Perkin told you now, Goosey?

148
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,291
Och, in the name of the Father, Birdy.

149
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,750
I must say my goodbyes
and get on with good humor.

150
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,416
I will go bravely
and with God in my heart.

151
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,583
Please give my brooch to my future sister.

152
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,958
And my Bible to my brother Edward,

153
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,875
and tell him that I'm sorry I got pudding
upon the pages.

154
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,541
Morwenna.

155
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,458
The blood came from my bum.

156
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,416
From your bum?

157
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,458
Oh, for the love of a god greater than I.

158
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,416
It comes from the other hole, Birdy.

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,416
What other hole?

160
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,958
It is your monthly tidings.

161
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
The lady in red.

162
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,750
So you will do your duty
to bear your husband children.

163
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,041
Then I shall run away. Far.

164
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,291
I shall steal a suit of armor
and become a knight and take...

165
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,083
take the horse and the carriage,
and I shall ride at midnight.

166
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,541
Dress as a knight or dress as a lady,
the blood will come.

167
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,375
You are a woman now, Birdy.

168
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,583
- Woman?
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,416
First of all, we're gonna make a pad.

170
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,791
Rag gets wrapped round hand.

171
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,833
Make it good and thick.

172
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,166
That is a nice wee pad
that sits in your pants.

173
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,666
You hold that.

174
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,875
- Are they my father's?
- No.

175
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,458
- These are your pants.
- My-my pants?

176
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,625
And this... Give me the pad.

177
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,541
Like that.

178
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,125
Up between your legs,
and then that's gonna get all the blood

179
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,250
and keep it away from your clothes.

180
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,916
Can you manage that?

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,666
Yes, I can, Morwenna.

182
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,166
Hey. Don't do that.

183
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,333
- Just be careful.
- I am!

184
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,250
We'll get some mint,

185
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,333
'cause that makes
the whole thing taste nice.

186
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,750
Dandelion...
But not the flower, obviously...

187
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,291
Is perfect for those cramps.

188
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,291
Alf, do you have your mum's knickers
on Wendy's head?

189
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,833
Och. Perkin.

190
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,416
What's he up to now,
dressing up farm animals?

191
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,916
A lamb should be dressed in mint sauce,
not a hat.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,541
All those herbs that we picked,

193
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,375
we're going to make tea
into your favorite cup.

194
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,958
It is my favorite cup.

195
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,250
It is your favorite cup. I know.

196
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,833
And swirl, and dip.

197
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,583
And take a sip, and the pain will be gone.

198
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,666
I...

199
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,166
What are you doing?

200
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,125
Knocking is, uh...
is customary, uh, Birdy,

201
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,416
although, I admit, maybe not
in the public houses that you frequent.

202
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,916
Public... I've never been
to a public house. Mama, he lies.

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,875
- I'm not lying, darling!
- Oh...

204
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,458
I'm jesting. There's a difference.

205
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,625
Although I did see you in the, uh,
public house the other night, didn't I?

206
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,833
Um, swearing and drinking ale,
getting into fights with peasants?

207
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,583
- Big punch-up, no? Huh?
- Mama?

208
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,666
I, for one, should like
my room free of jesters for the moment.

209
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,083
I should like to rest.

210
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,916
One more jest before I go, huh?

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,458
What did the Pope say to the ale rat?

212
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,041
What?

213
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,333
What?

214
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,875
Well, what did the Pope say
to the ale rat?

215
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,041
What did the Pope say to the...
What are you talking about?

216
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,625
- The jest.
- She gone... she gone mad?

217
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,125
The Pope and the ale rat.

218
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,583
What Pope?

219
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,541
- Which ale rat?
- Father...

220
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,375
Oh, yes. Um...

221
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,541
Mama?

222
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,000
Birdy.

223
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,791
I have something to tell you.
It's ever so serious, so...

224
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,916
- Mama, are you all right?
- Yes.

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,708
It's just the baby kicking.

226
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,750
What was it you wanted to say, darling?

227
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,916
<i>Maybe now is not a good time.</i>

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,708
<i>And perhaps I shall wait forever.</i>

229
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,750
- There's a hanging today in Rutherford.
- A hanging?

230
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,875
An ever so small one.
I was thinking I could maybe go...

231
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,500
Absolutely forbidden.

232
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,000
- Robert goes to all the hangings.
- Well, Robert is Robert, and you are not.

233
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,000
And anyhow, the Sidebottoms arrive today.

234
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,166
It's your favorite day of the month.

235
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,750
Come here to me, child.

236
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,708
Come and rest with your weary mother.

237
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:45,541
So nice to have you here, my darling.

238
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,166
I'm so tired.

239
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,083
<i>I'm always so tired.</i>

240
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,208
<i>When will I not be tired, Birdy?</i>

241
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,166
<i>Um, in a year?</i>

242
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,625
<i>In a year.</i>

243
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,875
It's the only one I could find.
Here they come.

244
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,333
<i>Today, Aelis comes.</i>

245
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,833
<i>She's a dearest friend to me.</i>

246
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,416
<i>- Can you see that?
- Yeah.</i>

247
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,541
You have a weak right eye...

248
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,458
- Yeah.
- So use the left.

249
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,833
Slowly, slowly…

250
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,875
Oh, God. Clumsy.

251
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,833
Oh, God, my...

252
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,583
<i>And when I see her face,
I hear birds and whistles.</i>

253
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,875
<i>I see ribbons, and I see flowers.</i>

254
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,833
<i>- Oh, Aelis.</i>
- Oh, Aelis.

255
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,458
Oh, every bone in my body is aching.

256
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,333
My mind is aching.

257
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,250
- Birdy, your hair's got so long.
- I know.

258
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,166
- It's so ducky.
- Birdy?

259
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,666
You must give me some kind of warning,

260
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,500
because the sight of your countenance,
it makes me...

261
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,666
it makes me feel...

262
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,083
Hi, Robert.

263
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,416
Lady Sidebottom.

264
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,833
Aelis.

265
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,416
Always very good to see you.

266
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,750
You're looking rather piquant.

267
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,916
Well, you look rather pink yourself.

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,625
Leave us be.

269
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,666
Do you ladies need an escort
around the garden?

270
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,500
It's... it-it can be very dangerous
around here.

271
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,416
Just go, you deathmonger. Go!

272
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,333
And the roses have, um...

273
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,125
- been exceptional this season.
- Absolutely wonderful.

274
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,625
And, of course, butterflies.

275
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,458
I hate butterflies.

276
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,083
We have already had, uh,
five or six marriage proposals,

277
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,416
all of them serious inquiries.

278
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
We've had, um, uh, nine...

279
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,625
Some of these letters are florid
in the extreme.

280
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,875
But I don't care if they are poets.

281
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,375
I care if they can pay
for my daughter in...

282
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,916
in gold brick.

283
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,250
Absolutely.

284
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,208
- Welcome to Stone bridge, Lady Aelis.
- Oh, you have buns!

285
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,916
Yes, I have buns.

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,666
I used to have more buns and cakes,
but now I think we're poor.

287
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,166
-We are not poor,
-Good.

288
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,875
But there's nothing to eat at our manor,

289
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,750
'cause Papa banished the baker
a month ago.

290
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,000
Why?

291
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,583
Well, he said that he and my stepmother

292
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,375
were exchanging wistful glances.

293
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,125
Hmm.

294
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,750
Thank you. Thank you.

295
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,583
My lady, I promise
I'm not spoiling my supper.

296
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,500
Oh. I do not give a goat's ass
what you spoil, Aelis.

297
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,666
Berenice! B-Berenice!

298
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,916
Never again leave a convivial grouping
when I'm speaking.

299
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,416
I... I was about to make
a point of great importance.

300
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,375
Well, I go where I want,

301
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,166
and I say what I please!

302
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,416
She's been writing the most tragic poetry.

303
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:59,833
Do you know my stepmother was brought
to our manor from Gascony?

304
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,208
- Gascony?
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,833
- First by boat, then by carriage.
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,916
Took many nights, and no one told her
where she was going.

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And then my father was waiting.

308
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,666
He sent away for a wife
the day after my mother died.

309
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,916
Men are horribly duplicitous creatures.

310
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,375
I should like to take
a carriage with you, Aelis.

311
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,208
How would we escape?

312
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:30,375
We'll, uh, steal a knight's armor
or a monk's robes or...

313
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,208
- I don't know.
- Well, where would we go?

314
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,541
Well...

315
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,458
Uncle George writes to me of the Crusades.

316
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,291
- Oh, Uncle George.
- So we could...

317
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,000
Uncle George, Uncle George!

318
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,791
All you ever speak about is Uncle George.

319
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,708
- Yes, because he comes soon, Aelis.
- Mm.

320
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,333
You know he's my best uncle.

321
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,833
He's your only uncle.

322
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,333
Yes.

323
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,458
<i>As the time approaches when we must wed,</i>

324
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,083
<i>we are forced to undertake lady lessons.</i>

325
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,791
<i>My two least favorite words,
together in one terrible phrase.</i>

326
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,583
Gently, young ladies.

327
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,500
A gentle hand plays a soothing tune.

328
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,625
<i>Sister Cornethia attempts to make me</i>

329
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>musical, pious and full of grace</i>

330
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,375
<i>for any suitor who may call.</i>

331
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,500
Do we find our lessons ever so funny?

332
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,625
It seems to me a joke is astir.

333
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,916
No.

334
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,125
<i>But she will find she has no easy job.</i>

335
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,750
My lord.

336
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,083
I want to meet the baby.

337
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,375
I want to meet the baby.

338
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,916
Birdy, please go for Mama.

339
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Catherine, come on. You must to bed.

340
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,458
Why does he get to meet the baby?

341
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,791
Only God will meet this baby, Birdy.

342
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,208
<i>I will never get used
to babies coming dead.</i>

343
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:22,333
<i>And my heart will never stop aching
for them to live.</i>

344
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,791
<i>I continue to hide my rags
so that my father</i>

345
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,041
<i>will not make me a wife and a mother,</i>

346
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,833
<i>and I will keep hiding them
over and over...</i>

347
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,750
<i>forever.</i>

348
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,625
<i>Mother usually checks in on Edward
at the abbey,</i>

349
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:42,625
<i>but she still loses blood from the birth
so sends me in her place.</i>

350
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,166
<i>We are too poor to offer the monks
any pies anymore.</i>

351
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,166
<i>I simply bring myself.</i>

352
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,083
<i>I always imagined that Edward lived
amongst God-fearing old nutters</i>

353
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,958
<i>and musty old men who clutched
their Bibles to their chests.</i>

354
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,500
<i>Ooh-la-la.</i>

355
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,166
<i>Wait.</i>

356
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,875
<i>These are monks? Why hath no one told me?</i>

357
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,333
<i>I am ever so confused about
what God is getting at here.</i>

358
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,250
Psst. Edward.

359
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,083
Catherine. Sorry.

360
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,791
What are you doing here?

361
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm just visiting an old friend.

362
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,958
Get off Jesus.

363
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,208
Catherine.

364
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,166
Don't look at me like that.

365
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,791
<i>Salve,</i> gentlemen.

366
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,083
Ow!

367
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,000
Catherine!

368
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,041
How was I to know that comely young women
are a spiritual danger to monks?

369
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,208
You are no danger to anyone but yourself.

370
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,083
Does Mother heal?

371
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,250
In body, if not in spirit.

372
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,375
Our brute of a father does not help.

373
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,333
Do you know what I find even worse
than the pain she bears?

374
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,208
It's the fact that
she must worry about us always.

375
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,458
Being a mother is a terrible job.

376
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,291
Birdy, please do not joust
with our crucified Savior.

377
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,916
Are there no better amusements
around here, Edward?

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,166
Perhaps a sacred sword used
to slay a pagan.

379
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,708
Not a sword in sight.

380
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,416
I do not believe you.
If I were a boy, you'd let me see.

381
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,000
Everybody lets boys do everything.

382
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,083
So boring, Edward.

383
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,750
Well, boredom is for
the dull-witted, Bird.

384
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,791
You're not dull, are you?

385
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,541
Of course I'm not dull.

386
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,208
How goes your reading
and the diary I've tasked you with?

387
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,625
I write in my diary every day
and read the Bible over and over again.

388
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,166
I know all the important prayers by heart.

389
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,583
I have something for you, actually.

390
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,041
A gift.

391
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,291
Oh, good. A book.

392
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,375
Well, now that I've captured
your attention,

393
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,125
mayhap you actually read it.

394
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,208
It is a book of the saints.

395
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,666
Each day, a different saint.

396
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,750
Promise me you shall read,

397
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,875
and read and read and read some more.

398
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,791
And write, too.

399
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,000
Knowing your own story
will be your salvation.

400
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,500
Promise.

401
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,875
Mayhap I could be a saint.

402
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:02,875
Well, for starters, I believe saints
help their nursemaids with the washing.

403
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,958
<i>Why does Edward want me to read this book</i>

404
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,166
<i>so full of strangers and their woes?</i>

405
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,416
<i>For saints are just dinguses
I will never actually meet.</i>

406
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,375
<i>At the very least, I'll become an expert
on their gruesome deaths,</i>

407
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,333
<i>which are so displeasing
that they please me terribly.</i>

408
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,333
<i>What does "defenestration" mean?</i>

409
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,291
<i>- A mission towards glory.</i>
- Ow! Ow!

410
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,375
<i>-I don't want to be a lady,</i>
<i>so perhaps a saint? </i>-Ow! Ow.

411
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,166
Birdy, put some shoes on,
for heaven's sake.

412
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,458
I cannot.

413
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,375
If I'm to be a saint,
I'm to practice self-sacrifice.

414
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,833
Ow!

415
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,833
Any other jolly little plans
for this afternoon?

416
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,000
Why, yes, actually.

417
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,333
I'm denying myself buns.

418
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,708
I'm also going to sleep
with a comb beneath my back,

419
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,500
for I must emulate Saint Blandina,

420
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,458
who was scourged,
placed on a red-hot grate

421
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,625
and then thrown before a wild steer

422
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,000
who tossed her into the air
with his horns.

423
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,541
Tragically, she was killed with a dagger.

424
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,666
You'll meet a dagger
if you don't put your bloody shoes on.

425
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,833
- Birdy.
- Morwenna!

426
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,500
<i>I cannot believe I must bear this
with good humor month after month.</i>

427
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,375
<i>I would prefer a monthly bath in poo</i>

428
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,375
<i>or to wrestle a lion.</i>

429
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,583
<i>Oh, to wrestle a lion.</i>

430
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,333
Well, can I be blamed
for wanting us to have a bit of joy,

431
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,583
for wanting you to have a bit of joy?

432
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,958
Every year for the past six,
we've lost a child.

433
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:26,083
Rollo, why did you not tell me
we have naught to spend?

434
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,666
I want only to be your partner,
to stand beside you as lady of this manor.

435
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,041
Because the lady needs
to have her garlands,

436
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,375
she needs to have her silver twine,
she needs to have apples in her roast,

437
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:41,166
and I have to keep this family
from descending into utter poverty!

438
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,375
And Birdy is our only currency,
so we're in real trouble.

439
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,125
Ow.

440
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,125
Perkin?

441
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,875
Yes, Bird?

442
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,333
What do you suppose about kissing?

443
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,041
Suppose how?

444
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,458
Might it not be as vile
as we once thought?

445
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,416
God's thumbs, it's slimy!

446
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,958
Ugh.

447
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,333
Come on.

448
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,250
What do you even want, anyway?

449
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,833
Good tidings.

450
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:32,583
From Kent, where the weather is finer
than the silk from Kashmir.

451
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,791
Laid out upon a table for 20.

452
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,791
May I ask you, where's your mistress?

453
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,625
- Our mistress?
- Yes.

454
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,708
Lady Catherine of the manor.

455
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:45,833
The fair cherub
I have traveled so far to meet.

456
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:49,083
What are your intentions
with our mistress, sir?

457
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:52,791
If she is as fair and as goodly
and as decent as I've heard tell,

458
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:56,500
then I suppose
I shall marry her forthwith.

459
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,000
- Marry her? Lady Catherine?
- Uh, uh...

460
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,125
Yes, I've come here to propose marriage.

461
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,958
To our-our Lady Catherine?

462
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,458
- You cannot mean our Lady Catherine.
- Our Lady Catherine?

463
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:10,208
I do mean your Lady Catherine,
as a matter of fact.

464
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,541
As I've told you,
I've ridden all this way.

465
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,625
I've actually incurred several
psoas injuries during the process,

466
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,541
because Hercules is broader
than you might imagine.

467
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,291
So, if you could just tell me where...

468
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,166
No, no, sir, we know Lady Catherine,
and you really shouldn't have bothered.

469
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,041
We're just a bit confused why you would
travel all this way for such a...

470
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,708
Sh-She's a creature, a vile creature.

471
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,625
- All, uh, teeth and hair and...
- Awful. Terrible.

472
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,208
...vomit and snot.

473
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,875
- Some say she has a third ear.
- She does.

474
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,000
Have you seen this third ear?

475
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,125
- I've seen it.
- Where?

476
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,750
Back of her neck.

477
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,041
Is it functional?

478
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,458
- Spare.
- Spare.

479
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,916
Now, what... where is the Lady Catherine
that I have heard of

480
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,583
who has ebony tresses
that tumble like waterfalls?

481
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:54,250
The Lady Catherine that has
the curves of an archipelago?

482
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,833
Arch-Archipelago?

483
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,125
What is an archipelago?

484
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,791
A small series of little islands,
I believe.

485
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,791
- You've been tricked... cruelly, cruelly tricked.
- You've been tricked.

486
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:07,083
- Yes, I think...
- Very cruelly, sir.

487
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,291
I have been tricked, and cruelly so.

488
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:12,291
Sir, you best be off before Lady Catherine
comes and rears her ugly head.

489
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,916
I want to thank you, actually.

490
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,708
- You're very, very dashing.
- Thanks.

491
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:18,208
You, on the other hand, have been
a little churlish, if I may say so.

492
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,125
Thank you very much, sir.

493
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:28,541
I will not sneak you a jug of ale, Birdy,
so do not ask it of me.

494
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,041
- I demand to know the meaning of this.
- Meaning of what?

495
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,541
A man has come and asked for me by name.

496
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,166
- Sounds improbable.
- He hails from Kent.

497
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,750
Oh, yes.

498
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,875
Yes. That's good, good, good.

499
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,708
Um, well, you better
get-get yourself washed up.

500
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,083
- I've sent him away.
- You sent him away?

501
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,666
I sent him away.

502
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,416
I'm not interested in meeting him
nor any man with his intentions.

503
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,916
No, Birdy, go up to the high road
and get him back.

504
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,250
I'm afraid he's quite gone.

505
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,083
In fact, he galloped away.

506
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,583
No...

507
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,541
Right. I...

508
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,333
Where's the... Where is the... I need...

509
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:12,916
Hand.

510
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,958
<i>Things girls cannot do.</i>

511
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,083
<i>Go on Crusades.</i>

512
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,791
<i>Cut their hair.</i>

513
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,166
<i>Be horse trainers.</i>

514
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,125
<i>Laugh very loud.</i>

515
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,750
<i>Marry whom they will.</i>

516
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,958
<i>Be monks.</i>

517
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,750
<i>Drink in alehouses.</i>

518
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,208
<i>Go to hangings.</i>

519
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,958
You will behave like a lady
when a suitor comes to call,

520
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,625
- or we are going to end up in the cooper's cellar.
- Stop. No, Rollo.

521
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,875
- Rollo!
- Do you understand that?

522
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,125
I cannot bear it. Stop it, please.

523
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,041
Do you realize your daughter has sent away
a perfectly good suitor?

524
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:53,083
Do not rage over that man.

525
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,041
My fathers were kings of Britain long ago.

526
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:58,333
He's just a simple wool merchant
from Kent.

527
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,583
My darling,
we cannot eat your royal fathers.

528
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:03,458
We cannot plant your ancestors.

529
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,958
That man was...

530
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,416
incredibly rich.

531
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,000
She is young yet.

532
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,666
She cannot even bear children.

533
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,041
No, I most certainly cannot.

534
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,750
Just give her some time.

535
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,500
Some time.

536
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,291
<i>Just one more day until Uncle George.</i>

537
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:34,333
<i>After one man brought doom on horseback,
another brings divine hope.</i>

538
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,875
<i>My uncle is so unlike
any other man that I know.</i>

539
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,125
<i>He has a twinkle in his holy green eyes,</i>

540
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:52,583
<i>a song on his lips and all his teeth.</i>

541
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,708
How was your day, my love?

542
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:01,000
It was, uh... it was fine.

543
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,708
Don't say "fine," Robert.

544
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,166
It's boring. Don't bore your mother.

545
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:10,625
I cannot believe that my only sister's
only daughter is now up to my shoulder.

546
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,708
When I left, you were wearing a nappy
with a big wooden pin;

547
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:17,833
a tiny barbarian the size of a toadstool.

548
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,166
Mother told us that you were
in the Holy Land

549
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,541
wearing a red cross on a white tunic,

550
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,833
nobly fighting for God and Christ
and our king.

551
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:31,708
The truth, I'm afraid,
was much less picturesque.

552
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,416
My tunic was covered in mud and thistles.

553
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,125
But there was a line, a line of Crusaders,

554
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:40,458
leading from Jerusalem
all the way to London, wasn't there?

555
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,541
There was a line.

556
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:48,000
It was a line of the injured
waiting to be treated for their wounds.

557
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,208
Fun and games, it was not.

558
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,750
Will you ever put that wee stick away?

559
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,708
It's not a stick.

560
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,625
It's a bear.

561
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,250
From Uncle George.

562
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,541
- Oh, a gift from Uncle Georgie.
- Quiet!

563
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,333
- Oh, Georgie. Oh...
- Morwenna!

564
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,791
You're just jealous 'cause no one's ever
whittled you a gift.

565
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,666
- No, that's right.
- Especially not a bear.

566
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,541
Like mine, from George.

567
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:37,041
Oh, no, that's right...
No gifts for poor Morwenna.

568
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,750
Oh, dear.

569
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,166
Come on, get into bed.

570
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,916
That's enough.

571
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,291
- That's enough.
- Uh-huh.

572
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,458
- Night night.
- Night night.

573
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:52,125
And don't be having my eye out
with that thing.

574
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,125
<i>If I cannot be a hero,</i>

575
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,125
<i>I will love a hero instead.</i>

576
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,666
<i>He will tell my father
he cannot sell me off this way,</i>

577
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,875
<i>and he will fight for me.</i>

578
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:46,791
Does he look
much like the archangel Michael?

579
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,041
- Mm, no.
- Mm.

580
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,416
No dead saint could be as beautiful as he.

581
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,833
Mm. Well, I must see him for myself, then.

582
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,083
If I were to marry, Aelis...

583
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,291
If... if...

584
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,916
- ...then I should choose him.
- Mm.

585
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,416
If only he were my cousin
and not my uncle.

586
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,625
I'm sorry.

587
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,833
True love can prevail.

588
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,375
You know there's a cottage raising today?

589
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,833
Birdy, you know we would be whipped.

590
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You get whipped?

591
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:21,000
My father only beats me across the hand
with his rod. That's all.

592
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:26,416
Cottage raisings are not for girls
with suitors calling.

593
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,541
<i>And so I watched
the cottage raising from the hill,</i>

594
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,875
<i>clean for my suitors
but full of dirty rage.</i>

595
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:36,750
<i>I shall never smear myself with mud again
and shove Perkin onto the ground.</i>

596
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,666
<i>I shall never get to see a hanging.</i>

597
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,041
<i>I shall never get to have
anything like fun.</i>

598
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,833
<i>And just because
my birthright is to bleed.</i>

599
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,833
No, this game is absolute rubbish.

600
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,583
I feel completely defeated.

601
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,000
- You are so pathetic.
- Shut up!

602
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,875
- Oh, they're hot! Oh, they're hot!
- You have to teach me this.

603
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,916
<i>Many people are afeard
of Allhallows Eve,</i>

604
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,416
<i>of the dead who come back
to visit the earth.</i>

605
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,166
<i>But the only dead I know
are my tiny brothers and sisters</i>

606
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,875
<i>who died before they were even born,
and how could I be afeard of them?</i>

607
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,666
<i>I wish they would come visit.</i>

608
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,708
<i>It would ease my mother's grieving.</i>

609
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:39,333
- Birdy. Birdy.
- Aelis!

610
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,291
- Do you like my horn?
- It's so lovely.

611
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,083
- Morwenna sewed it.
- It's so sweet.

612
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,916
Oh, sorry.

613
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,625
George.

614
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,833
Hello, Bird. That's a nice-looking crown.

615
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,208
It's a horn.

616
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,083
I saw a man with gloves
like devil's claws,

617
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,541
and I became frightened.

618
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,583
I was hiding behind the henhouse
when this kind gentleman found me.

619
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,083
That is my Uncle George, Aelis.

620
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,833
The one who you've so often spoken of?

621
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:08,291
Well, yes, it must be he.

622
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:13,000
For you said he was kind
and handsome, too.

623
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,916
I, too, was quite shaken
by that clawed man

624
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,916
with the long, gnarled fingers and...

625
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,958
I think I saw… -And did you see
the mummer with the, um...

626
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,833
the big lump on his face?

627
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:22,958
Red, angry lump...
Was that a costume, do you think?

628
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,375
Or, uh, it's a natural affliction?

629
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,375
Let me get you both safely back
to your chambers.

630
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,875
- No, we want to see the mummers and the dancing.
- Yes...

631
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,083
Boo!

632
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,500
I've died, Birdy,

633
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:39,166
and now I'm just a ghost sent to haunt you
until the end of your life.

634
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,750
Ooh...

635
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,083
That's enough of this silliness, goat boy.

636
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,041
I was simply trying to get back
to my chamber

637
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,458
to read some lovely verse
before falling to peaceful sleep

638
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:49,916
and entering dreamland.

639
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,250
I'll...

640
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,625
leave you to your friends, then...

641
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,625
Lady Catherine.

642
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:16,000
My father's agreed I might stay
for a whole fortnight.

643
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,000
Or even two.

644
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,416
I wish you'd written to ask.

645
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,833
How do you know it's convenient for me?

646
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:28,625
I have a great many chores.

647
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,833
<i>Why am I being so unkind?</i>

648
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,791
<i>I am agitated.</i>

649
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,791
<i>I blame the eel pie.</i>

650
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,333
Come on, little orange...

651
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,666
<i>It is definitely not the eel pie.</i>

652
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,291
Catherine?

653
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:21,625
Your father has found your monthly rags
stuffed inside the privy.

654
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,833
They were peeking behind the cracks.

655
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,416
- They're not mine.
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,416
How did you know?

657
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,625
Catherine, I am your mother
and lady of this manor.

658
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,541
There is naught I do not see
and naught I do not know,

659
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:40,708
and I will tell you, it is useless
to stuff your rags, no matter how deep.

660
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,125
Now, I've been trying my best
to protect you.

661
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:54,041
But your father is waiting for his chance
to make you a wife

662
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:57,541
and to bring propriety to this manor,
and I can deny him no more.

663
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,875
Do I not have a say?

664
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,458
Everything has its time, its season.

665
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:09,541
It is your season, my love.

666
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,083
Traitor.

667
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,583
- And a liar and a fiend! Devil!
- Oh! Catherine!

668
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:15,916
I hate you!

669
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,583
- Birdy, no! Stop it now!
- I hate you! I hate you! -Stop.

670
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,000
- I hate you!
- Stop!

671
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:23,333
That's enough! That is enough!

672
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,625
I am shocked.

673
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,833
<i>I have not a friend in the world.</i>

674
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,625
<i>I have been cruel to Perkin.</i>

675
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,375
<i>Morwenna has betrayed me.</i>

676
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:38,083
<i>Uncle George, who brought gaiety
and wonder into my life,</i>

677
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,416
<i>loves Aelis, who is a weasel.</i>

678
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,333
<i>And now my time is here.</i>

679
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:44,458
<i>I ripen like a peach for plucking.</i>

680
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,166
Birdy.

681
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,041
Unrecognizable.

682
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,375
<i>I feel as though no part of me is my own.</i>

683
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:56,666
Your father told me to scrub
every nook and cranny of you

684
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,000
before the guests arrive.

685
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,958
<i>Would I choose to die
rather than be forced to marry?</i>

686
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:05,208
<i>I do not think either option
appealing or fair.</i>

687
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,291
Where is the girl?

688
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,791
I think she's just making herself...

689
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,375
- uh, beautiful for you.
- Bathing her teeth.

690
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,333
Yes, thank you.

691
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,541
Wow. I like this.

692
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,000
- Entertainment.
- Yes.

693
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,958
- For me? Ah, bravo!
- Yes.

694
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,833
Very nice.

695
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,041
Now, where is the girl?

696
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,041
- Yes, where is... where is she?
- Where is the girl?

697
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,541
That is the girl.

698
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:34,041
Now, may I ask something of you?

699
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,833
Anything, Lady Catherine.

700
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:42,166
Will you prove your love to me
by wearing my birds upon your face?

701
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,458
To wear them? Like...

702
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,708
This is Juniper.

703
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,041
This is Breadberry.

704
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,166
This is Sir Neal.

705
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,791
Lard Turd.

706
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,958
This one on my head is okay?

707
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,083
Mm-hmm.

708
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,500
Hello.

709
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:02,083
Oh, he's very close to my face.

710
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,916
<i>If I still had Aelis to speak to,</i>

711
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,708
<i>I might be less lonely in my beatings.</i>

712
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,166
<i>But she has George.</i>

713
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,916
<i>And I have smarting palms.</i>

714
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,541
Might you share some of your passions?

715
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,958
Hobbies.

716
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,625
Your soul's deepest inclination.

717
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,750
I listen to God when he speaks to me.

718
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,000
- A pious girl.
- Mm-hmm.

719
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:28,416
Usually, he tells me to form an army...
5,000 women strong...

720
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,375
And to go around and gut all men
and leave their entrails as offerings.

721
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,583
<i>Double devil.</i>

722
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,458
<i>Snail's guts.</i>

723
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,375
<i>Fanny in a hat.</i>

724
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,416
<i>Ugh!</i>

725
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,541
<i>No curse is good enough
for these vile suitors.</i>

726
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,625
{\an8}<i>Or my viler father.</i>

727
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,041
<i>Farting drumsticks!</i>

728
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,291
Ugh!

729
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,916
Our beautiful daughter is...

730
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,583
is going to sing for you.

731
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,666
It's her own composition.

732
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,625
She wrote it herself.

733
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,625
Yes. All right, all right, all right.

734
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,041
You can't.

735
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,541
I can.

736
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,000
No, you can't!

737
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,500
Birdy.

738
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,500
- Birdy.
- Meg! Meg.

739
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,500
I stole the keys off of sleeping Ferth
the gate man.

740
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,041
Here, the heel of the bread
and some butter.

741
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,083
Meg, I knew it.
You've always been a rebel.

742
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,416
And a true friend.

743
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,250
- Oh, milady.
- Not "milady."

744
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,708
Never "milady."

745
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:15,916
Oh. All right, milady.

746
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,208
Oh.

747
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,541
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

748
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,416
Birdy.

749
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,791
Just Birdy.

750
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,375
<i>When I was young, Father had
a golden Jesus that pissed wine.</i>

751
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:49,708
<i>Now we just cut the brown parts
from the carrots.</i>

752
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,708
- Wait, this...
- East. East.

753
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:53,000
- East?
- East.

754
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,666
Ea... Your east or my east?

755
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,708
Your-your west, your east.

756
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:59,166
- Uh, just northeast.
- What are you looking for?

757
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,333
I want it to feel like heaven is-is...

758
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:04,791
is-is coming in through the windows
and hitting the lights.

759
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,166
Fear not, for I bring you great news.

760
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,458
To you, a Savior is born.

761
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:11,833
A child?

762
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:13,791
It cannot be,

763
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:17,375
for I am just a simple young virgin.

764
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,291
Why is that so funny?

765
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,541
If she's a virgin, I'm a princess.

766
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,833
I have had nary a man.

767
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,500
There's no room in the inn.

768
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:29,708
What a crap inn.

769
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:32,166
We can shelter in this barn

770
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,250
with our baby.

771
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,458
Aw.

772
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:41,625
We have come to pay him homage
with gifts from the Orient.

773
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:44,083
<i>My eyes prick and water.</i>

774
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,416
<i>Perhaps I'm allergic to cheer.</i>

775
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,708
<i>After all, a diary is no substitute
for a friend.</i>

776
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,875
I'm sorry.

777
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:18,291
Me best line was coming.

778
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:27,791
Keep it very fine, ladies.

779
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,875
Very fine.

780
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,875
Will you be angry with me forever?

781
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,541
- Perhaps I shall be, Aelis.
- Ladies!

782
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,583
We learn best when we close our mouths
and open our ears.

783
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:42,875
But I have done nothing wrong.

784
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:45,208
Except for stealing the man I loved
with all my heart.

785
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,500
Behind my back, no less.

786
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:51,500
To me, you are a deceitful coward.

787
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,416
Oh, shh!

788
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,666
Aelis, I disavow my terrible mouth.

789
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,125
She's a beast, my mouth,
and she acted without my consent.

790
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:05,916
Bad Birdy! Bad, bad.

791
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,958
- Birdy! Birdy!
- Bad Birdy! Bad! Ow.

792
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,375
Psst.

793
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,500
I am to be married.

794
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,250
To George?

795
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,625
No.

796
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:16,791
Good.

797
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,125
To a boy of only nine.

798
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:23,041
George has decided to marry
some torrid old widow named Ethelfritha.

799
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,458
And now you won't even be my friend.

800
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:31,583
<i>For the first time in my life,
I am choking on my words.</i>

801
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:35,000
<i>My heart has been shaved
and boiled like a parsnip.</i>

802
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:39,625
<i>George is to be married.
George is to be married.</i>

803
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,875
<i>George is to be married.</i>

804
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:45,041
I don't suppose you're taking
any new joiners at the convent?

805
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,041
No.

806
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,541
Pity.

807
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,916
<i>1291 is upon us, and I have seen
the consequences of my horrid temperament.</i>

808
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,916
<i>Friendlessness, boredom, purgatory.</i>

809
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,166
<i>So I embrace a new resolve.</i>

810
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,125
<i>I will try my best to be a lady,</i>

811
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,791
<i>to act and speak as beautifully
as my mother does,</i>

812
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:09,583
<i>to make my parents and God divinely happy.</i>

813
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,875
I am a woman now,

814
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,958
so I will dress myself.

815
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,833
- It's back to front.
- It's not!

816
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,375
Look.

817
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,958
<i>Disobedience has gotten me nowhere.</i>

818
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,500
What in the gods' name was that?

819
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,791
<i>And who can fight
an inevitable fate, anyhow?</i>

820
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,375
Oh, listen to the birds, birds.

821
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:40,958
<i>I resisted marriage
and was dealt only pain.</i>

822
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,875
<i>If I embrace it, mayhap there is even...</i>

823
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,583
Feel the breeze.

824
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,291
<i>...pleasure?</i>

825
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:50,625
Caressing your nostrils.

826
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:55,791
Lady Catherine, do you enjoy riding?

827
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:59,708
I do, my lord, really enjoy riding.

828
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,125
Well, perhaps you and my son
might ride together

829
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,958
- whilst we are here.
- Oh, yes.

830
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,208
Will your horses get along?

831
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,833
I-I believe so.

832
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:13,208
My... my horse has a lovely
and even temperament.

833
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,750
Do you not hate having
to dress up for these meetings?

834
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,500
Lord, yes. I really do.

835
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,541
This dress is so tight,
it's hard to breathe.

836
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,875
Is yours tight?

837
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:28,250
No, this one's not so bad.

838
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:31,750
Uh, it's, uh, fortunate that you're here
this evening, um, Fulks,

839
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,708
um, because we have, um,
some rather joyous news

840
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:38,250
that, uh, we're going to, uh, have a baby.

841
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,333
- What? This is tremendous.
- Yes.

842
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,083
I-I love babies!

843
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,916
What did you say, Father?

844
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,625
Aren't you excited, Catherine?

845
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:47,708
The midwife has said
it may bleed her out this time.

846
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,375
Not now, Birdy.

847
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:51,208
This isn't the time, really, is it, Birdy?

848
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,375
Are you trying to kill her?

849
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:56,208
Do you really want to prove
yourself a man that much?

850
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,375
It is going to die.

851
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,625
- They all die!
- You-you didn't die.

852
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:02,791
- I didn't die, but the rest do!
- Catherine!

853
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:05,333
- Catherine, come...
- They all die!

854
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,666
- I do think she's come down with something.
- Shaking.

855
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,291
She's got a little, little, um...
little, little, little bit of...

856
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,541
I think there's a little bit of pox
going around in the village.

857
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,666
- Oh, no, not pox.
- Pox? Pox?

858
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,375
No, I mean, it's not around the village.

859
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,708
- Uh, we best depart.
- No, you don't need to go.

860
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,250
- It's not a big pox.
- It's a small pox.

861
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,916
- It-it's actually... it's a tiny pox.
- Not smallpox.

862
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,333
- It's not the smallpox.
- It's only a small little... pox.

863
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,875
Hello.

864
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,625
I despise you.

865
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,791
I thought we got on rather well.

866
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,500
Let me pass my meal in peace!

867
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:57,166
<i>My new leaf was short-lived.</i>

868
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:00,416
<i>But my rebellion will be forever.</i>

869
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,666
What are you trying to do, baptize it?

870
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,458
- Drown it! Drown it!
- I'll get another.

871
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,750
No, Fulks! Fulks!

872
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:10,583
Fulk, come ba... Fulk!

873
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,416
Fulks!

874
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,458
Why is that bucket so small?!

875
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:18,166
Do you not understand the danger
that you placed us in?

876
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,625
Catherine!

877
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:23,208
For once, you might attempt
to set a good example

878
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:26,625
to our tenants and to our villagers,
to show them what a...

879
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:31,416
what a... what a lady might be
instead of subjecting us to all the...

880
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,125
shame!

881
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,750
Humiliation!

882
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,625
But I am not a lady, sir,
thus cannot mimic one.

883
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:43,416
Sit down. Sit down!

884
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:50,875
When I was a year younger than you,
I inherited a town in shambles.

885
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,750
My father had gambled away every brick,
every pane of glass,

886
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:01,083
every sack of grain, everything,

887
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,208
so I had to use every ounce

888
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:07,708
of my cunning and my strength

889
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:10,583
to bring this town back to prosperity.

890
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:14,333
Your cunning and your strength?

891
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:18,000
Among other qualities, yes.

892
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:21,791
Is that why I saw Grandfather's tapestries
going to auction?

893
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:27,416
Mother's wedding cups being packed up
and shipped away

894
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,333
because of your cunning and your strength?

895
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,166
I'm your father.

896
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:44,000
And if I say that you shall be married...

897
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,791
...then married you shall be.

898
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,375
<i>George weds today.</i>

899
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:05,250
<i>Some marry for love,
some marry for money, some for duty,</i>

900
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,875
<i>and some... like George...
Seem not to know why they marry.</i>

901
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,166
Does anyone present know of any reason

902
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:16,333
why this man and woman
should not be joined in holy matrimony?

903
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:25,333
Since there are no objections,
do you take this man to be your husband?

904
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:32,500
{\an8}I will.

905
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,708
And will you take this woman
to be your wife?

906
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,333
I... will.

907
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:42,791
I will.

908
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,000
<i>In no mine Patris...</i>

909
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,791
<i>In no mine Patris...</i>

910
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,500
<i>- Et Filii...
- Et Filii...</i>

911
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,916
<i>Et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

912
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,750
Will you tell your daughter no crying?

913
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,458
- No, she can cry if she wants to.
- Sidebottoms do not cry.

914
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,166
- That is enough.
- She'll get used to it.

915
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,625
{\an8}And she's got a fine young man there

916
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:06,791
{\an8}who is going to grow up into a fine,
uh, specimen.

917
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,541
She has a nine-year-old boy.

918
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,666
Amen.

919
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,125
Amen.

920
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,875
That's it. Push it, push it, push it,
push it, push it, push it.

921
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,500
- I'm pushing.
- That's it, that's it. Thank you.

922
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:28,083
Does your uncle not look dashing, Birdy?

923
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:42,958
Corpus bones.

924
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:46,000
Must my world always be
peppered with shit?

925
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,666
A mouth to shame a pirate.

926
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,500
I'm endeavoring to find
the best curse of them all.

927
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,958
Is it "corpus bones,"
or is it "God's thumbs"?

928
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:59,041
Or is it a simple
"Satan and all his minions"?

929
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:03,500
I personally go in for
"death by frying pan."

930
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:09,750
You're selling mittens.

931
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,666
It grows colder and colder, so I travel

932
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,416
from town to town
searching for those whose fingers shiver.

933
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,208
I have not a coin to my name, sir.

934
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:20,083
I am but a servant.

935
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,541
A servant in a fancy dress, though.

936
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:27,000
And if you do not have the funds,
then a kiss will do.

937
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,041
A ki...

938
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,083
Death by frying pan.

939
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,208
I cannot kiss you.

940
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,916
For I have never kissed anyone in my life.

941
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,541
And I would get beat by a rod.

942
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:45,041
Then can I kiss you
and take all the blame?

943
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:56,833
<i>That was it? That was what
made George and Aelis go so mad?</i>

944
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:02,000
<i>Well, he looks rather pleased
with himself.</i>

945
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,125
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

946
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,291
Good evening.

947
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,208
Good evening, mitten man.

948
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:24,041
So weird.

949
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,833
Yes!

950
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,958
<i>Might I really count that
as my first kiss?</i>

951
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,666
<i>I suppose I would like to,</i>

952
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,833
<i>especially if it's the only one
I'll ever choose to have myself.</i>

953
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:08,000
I paid for these festivities myself,
you know.

954
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:10,458
That's the one thing
husbands are good for.

955
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,541
Well, dead ones anyway.

956
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:17,458
It's very convenient when they die
wealthier than when you wed them,

957
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:20,583
although still rather sad.

958
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:23,333
This is the first party
we've had in months.

959
00:55:23,416 --> 00:55:25,041
Oh, dear.

960
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:27,791
We have no money left, unlike you.

961
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:32,166
And there's so much food here tonight
that I've lost my appetite.

962
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,833
Maybe love makes me ill.

963
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,375
Who said anything about love?

964
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,875
Do I believe your Uncle George loves me?

965
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:42,250
No, I do not.

966
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:46,833
But he will protect me
as only a husband can protect a wife.

967
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:50,458
And I inherited his title, and, um...

968
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:53,250
I hear he's rather good with a sword.

969
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,708
And he, in turn, gets to have some land
he can call his own.

970
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:59,708
See? The perfect trade.

971
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,875
Plus, he is rather gorgeous.

972
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:05,125
Do you not want to...

973
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,833
love someone properly?

974
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:10,375
I have other fish to fry.

975
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:13,791
You are so lucky, little bird.

976
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,666
Look.

977
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,583
You have wings.

978
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:25,250
You must learn how to harness them,

979
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:29,416
not flap them all about
and crash to the floor.

980
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,916
Will you excuse me for a minute,

981
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,041
Aunt Ethelfritha?

982
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,958
Of course, little beautiful Bird.

983
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:41,541
Don't fly the coop.

984
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,541
Try the tart. It's spinach.

985
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,708
- What are you trying to do? You know...
- Just have a nibble.

986
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:49,250
You know very well I've got
an ulcer the size of a pig's ass.

987
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,375
- It's soft. It's pastry.
- Are you trying to kill me?

988
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:52,708
Just stop it.

989
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,375
I wish you the same things
you wish for yourself.

990
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,500
What?

991
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:04,875
I wish you happiness, Aelis.

992
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,791
And I'm so sorry
that I ever said otherwise.

993
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,291
Ever since we quarreled,
I've done nothing but miss you.

994
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,458
And there is so much to tell.

995
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:16,166
In fact, I have only two words.

996
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:19,708
Mitten man.

997
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,333
Aelis!

998
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:26,416
Hey, would you like to see my doll?

999
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,208
He has a turnip for a head.

1000
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:31,250
- And who are you?
- Why, I'm her husband, of course.

1001
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:34,375
- Of course. Of course.
- A fine...

1002
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:38,625
fine, handsome husband he is, too, huh?

1003
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,083
Quiet! Quiet!

1004
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:51,708
Silence! Silence!

1005
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:58,916
Another one of them
will blow this shithole down.

1006
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:03,125
You muck-spouting fopdoodles!

1007
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,750
I'm the seventh-richest man in Yorkshire.

1008
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:12,000
And I want to fornicate.

1009
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:15,166
- Come here, you little scrubber.
- Ew!

1010
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,250
<i>Adults call me insolent,</i>

1011
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:20,375
<i>but have they ever met
their own drunken friends? Blech.</i>

1012
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,458
Come on, come on. Upsy.

1013
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:27,333
There you go.

1014
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:30,291
Do you not love a wedding
with every beat of your heart?

1015
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,666
No, I do not.

1016
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,625
But it is strange that I should like
the woman who is taking George from us.

1017
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,500
Life can be quite a shock, Bird.

1018
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,166
Goodbye, Georgie.

1019
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,875
Bye, George!

1020
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,958
<i>That vomit was yet another shock.</i>

1021
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,166
Did you have a nice morning, Birdy?

1022
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,916
<i>Perplexingly pleasant.</i>

1023
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,166
I like your, uh...

1024
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,875
your hair... hair snakes.

1025
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,458
<i>Why does the shaggy-bearded cretin remain?</i>

1026
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,125
Uh, Lord Murgaw, did you know
that Catherine here spins

1027
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:11,208
some of the finest yarn in Stone bridge?

1028
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,166
I don't care too much about fabric.

1029
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:18,916
I'd dance in the nude
if it were not a sin.

1030
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,125
I bloody would.

1031
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:25,375
So, what do you like to... what do you
like to do? Do you like to, um...

1032
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,875
What's the thing that-that men do

1033
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,875
when they run after the...
with the animal with the...

1034
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,958
- With the arrow? Um, hunting.
- Fishing. Fishing, fishing.

1035
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,458
- No, no, I know hunting.
- Jousting.

1036
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:34,250
- Uh... it's something that men do.
- Chasing?

1037
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,708
- Jousting.
- Climbing trees.

1038
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:37,583
- All right, Robert. No.
- Climb a tree, then piss in it.

1039
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:39,666
So, what-what is it you like to do?

1040
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,375
I collect rare lizard skins.

1041
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:45,541
And I do puzzles.

1042
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:48,708
One piece a night,
everything in moderation.

1043
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:50,791
Except for the carnal.

1044
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,333
Oh, my God.

1045
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,666
What's "carnal"?

1046
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,541
It's just a... it's just a funny word.

1047
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,958
Something you should talk about to Mother.
She might know.

1048
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:04,625
- Really?
- Yeah.

1049
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:08,833
Enter.

1050
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,791
Yes, Father?

1051
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,708
My sweetest girl.

1052
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,416
My own raven-haired lass.

1053
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,333
My beloved daughter.

1054
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:33,000
"Beloved daughter."

1055
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:35,208
I'm not sure of who you speak, sir.

1056
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:39,375
My lady of Lithgow,
your bridegroom awaits you,

1057
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:42,750
and none of your tricks
will profit you now.

1058
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:47,708
The charade is over,
and you will move forward and out.

1059
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:51,333
The guest?

1060
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,500
Th-The...

1061
01:00:56,583 --> 01:01:01,750
the-the man they call Shaggy Beard
is my betrothed?

1062
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:07,208
Catherine, be respectful.
His name is Lord John Murgaw VIII.

1063
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:11,958
And he is the last
and blessedly most wealthy suitor.

1064
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,666
Is that clear?

1065
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,458
<i>He is not a man.</i>

1066
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,375
<i>He is a cave-dwelling troll.</i>

1067
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:36,000
<i>A murderer does not deserve
such a punishment.</i>

1068
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:39,041
<i>It cannot... It... it will not be.</i>

1069
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:45,250
<i>Luckily, I am most experienced
at outwitting suitors.</i>

1070
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,000
Uh...

1071
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:55,333
Catherine can be prone to unusual bouts
of silence sometimes, can't she, darling?

1072
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:57,125
Well, she speaks when she wishes

1073
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,458
and is a great deal of fun
most of the time.

1074
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,625
Lady Aislinn, may I say,

1075
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:04,541
I can only imagine how delightful
you must have been

1076
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,666
when your husband first procured you.

1077
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,833
You're bold, y-you're playful,

1078
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,916
but you have a strong sense of duty.

1079
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,708
Exactly my sort of woman.

1080
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:22,708
The only women I can't abide by
are criers.

1081
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:25,125
Can't bear them. They do me naughty.

1082
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,666
- Oh, here we go.
- Oh, wonderful.

1083
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,750
<i>Oh, criers. Hmm, I'm an expert crier,</i>

1084
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,708
<i>since the day I was born.</i>

1085
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,083
No.

1086
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:38,208
No, Father, you can't have killed Jiminy.

1087
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:39,916
You can't have killed Jiminy!

1088
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,625
- Oh, Birdy.
- Catherine.

1089
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:44,791
Jiminy was
the only friend that I ever had!

1090
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,375
Oh, Birdy.

1091
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:49,250
Jiminy!

1092
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:52,291
Who in God's name is Jiminy?

1093
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,750
Lady Catherine, am I to believe
that pig was a friend of yours.

1094
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,208
Spicy.

1095
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,166
- Oh, my God.
- Please, Rollo, make it stop.

1096
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,625
I can't control it.

1097
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:13,833
Go on, let's eat the bugger.

1098
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:18,625
I like her.

1099
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,250
Get off.

1100
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,333
Ooh.

1101
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:50,291
Who goes there?

1102
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,958
'Tis I, Lady Catherine.

1103
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:55,125
Ah. 'Tis your sweet wench, sir.

1104
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:59,000
How dare you call my future wife a wench,
you scobberlotcher!

1105
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:03,291
Sorry. I was just s-saying
low-quality things.

1106
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,916
I was not expecting to reveal
me skivvies to you

1107
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,416
before our wedding day, Lady Catherine.

1108
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,458
Well, why dabble in formality, my lord,
when we soon know

1109
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:14,833
that what's yours is mine,
what's mine is yours?

1110
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:19,083
Indeed it is, and indeed it will be.

1111
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:22,041
Indeed it is, and indeed...

1112
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,041
There's too many bloody voices
in this room!

1113
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:27,750
Yes, mine being the problem.

1114
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:31,041
I heard that your joints ache,
so I took it upon myself

1115
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,750
to prepare you a traditional
Stone bridge poultice.

1116
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,833
It is, uh, rather lovely
and highly medicinal.

1117
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:40,583
You simply smother it over
your elbows, knees, ankles,

1118
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:42,916
and let it soak into your bones.

1119
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,291
You are even more considerate
than you are beautiful, young lady.

1120
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:50,708
Considerate and beautiful,
and she curtsies.

1121
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:53,333
Whole package. Thank you.

1122
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,875
Good day, my lords.

1123
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,458
- Good day, milady.
- Bye.

1124
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:00,083
<i>Ah, my finest work yet.</i>

1125
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,041
<i>I can taste the freedom.</i>

1126
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:04,958
Poetry, that is something, isn't it?

1127
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:10,583
<i>Perkin truly is my heart's brother.</i>

1128
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:13,083
<i>And so we managed to resolve our troubles</i>

1129
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:16,583
<i>with a good old-fashioned arm wrestle,
which I won fair and square.</i>

1130
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,583
- You can do it. You can do it. Go on.
- Go on.

1131
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:19,833
Go on.

1132
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,708
- Meg?
- Yes, Birdy?

1133
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:29,791
What really is a virgin?

1134
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:32,125
A virgin?

1135
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:37,708
Well, um, you know how
a man has a sword down there?

1136
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,708
Well, women have a box.

1137
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:43,250
And, um, when you don't want to be
a virgin anymore,

1138
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:46,791
you ask the man if he can put
his sword in your box.

1139
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:49,333
Um, and it goes in and out and in and out.

1140
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:54,416
And it makes a kind of smoosh sound,
and then it's done, really.

1141
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,541
I thought a virgin was where
God made you pregnant.

1142
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,875
Oh, no, that was only that one virgin.

1143
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:02,333
<i>That is what a virgin is.</i>

1144
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,500
<i>I had no idea what I was asking.</i>

1145
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:05,750
Lady Catherine?

1146
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:09,416
Lady Catherine, might I join you?

1147
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,833
You're the reason I stink of shit.

1148
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,458
If the shoe fits.

1149
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:18,958
You thought you could outsmart me
with tomfoolery,

1150
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:22,500
but what you didn't bargain for
is that I...

1151
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:25,750
like the chase.

1152
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:30,375
Tomorrow, I shall be giving your father
the marriage purse,

1153
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:32,583
a large sum of gold for him,

1154
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:34,916
but this is for you.

1155
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:37,958
Take it.

1156
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,166
And when you spend that first piece
of silver on something pretty,

1157
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,333
just remember that it is you

1158
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:50,291
finally saying yes to me.

1159
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,541
<i>He will not be able to marry me,</i>

1160
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:01,708
<i>for I will not spend the coins,
just angrily hoard them.</i>

1161
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,541
- Birdy, come back here.
- Come back here.

1162
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:06,000
Birdy, come back.

1163
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:07,833
- Stop it, Birdy! Listen to me!
- Go on and whip me!

1164
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,708
- That's what you want, isn't it?
- Put your hands down.

1165
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,875
The lord has officially proposed,
and you must pack your bags.

1166
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:13,875
- You must pack your bags at once.
- You need to leave here.

1167
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,291
- No. No! No!
- Yes! Birdy, yes!

1168
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:16,625
- Yes, yes.
- You can't make me go.

1169
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,166
- Listen to me, Birdy.
- You can't make me go.

1170
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,708
- I'm tired. I am tired.
- He's tired.

1171
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,625
- You've got to do what I tell you.
- You need to stop...

1172
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,291
- I want to meet the baby.
- The baby does not come for months yet.

1173
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,208
You have to let me meet the baby.

1174
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:28,541
Please, Father, just let me meet the baby.

1175
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,666
I have to.

1176
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,333
Fine.

1177
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:38,333
You can meet the baby, but the moment...

1178
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:41,166
- The moment...
- Robert, shut up!

1179
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,666
The moment the baby is here,

1180
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,041
then you are not.

1181
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,125
Perkin!

1182
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,416
Perkin. Perkin!

1183
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,875
Why are you wailing so?

1184
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:56,916
Perkin, we must be married.

1185
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,250
You'd make
a sorry bride in this state, Birdy.

1186
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,875
All we have to do is
get married tomorrow in the village.

1187
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:05,458
And only Morwenna and Meg
and the pigs have to be there,

1188
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:07,833
and-and I will be Lady Perkin,

1189
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:09,916
- and the goats will be our children.
- Birdy.

1190
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,083
I do not want to marry you.

1191
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,125
You have to marry me.

1192
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:21,375
My life hangs in the balance,
and you refuse me.

1193
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:24,625
And what of my life? My plans?

1194
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:29,333
Do you ever ask what I dream of
when I lay my head down at night?

1195
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:31,166
No.

1196
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,375
If I was of fair face like Aelis,
you'd marry me.

1197
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:35,208
It's not about being fair-faced.

1198
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,666
- What is it about, then?
- I don't know.

1199
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,708
I just don't want to marry you.

1200
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:42,958
Or Aelis or Meg or Morwenna

1201
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:45,666
or any other woman God has
or shall put on this Earth.

1202
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,458
Would you rather marry a man instead?

1203
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:57,541
Perkin.

1204
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:03,750
We must run.

1205
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:06,416
We must run far away and never come back.

1206
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,958
That is always
your answer to everything, Birdy.

1207
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:11,708
Do you not see?

1208
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:14,958
You would like to ride into the Crusades,

1209
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:17,708
but you are a lady.

1210
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:20,666
I would like to be a great scholar,

1211
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:23,875
yet I cannot even read.

1212
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,791
We do not get to choose what we do.

1213
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:28,750
Life does not care about us.

1214
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:33,000
We are given our stations until death.

1215
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,666
Through the buckle...

1216
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,541
...till the pin...

1217
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,291
Holds the belt-end

1218
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:05,208
safely in.

1219
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:08,000
Hat on head...

1220
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,916
for rain or sun;

1221
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,875
Buttons... do up every one.

1222
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:31,666
- She kicks like a pony.
- She?

1223
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:35,291
I might like a sister.

1224
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:38,208
Edward and Robert have each other.

1225
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:39,750
I'm quite alone.

1226
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,208
Well, I should like that, too,

1227
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:45,583
but would she be as perfect
as my firstborn daughter?

1228
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:49,666
You are as naughty
as God had hoped you might be.

1229
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:00,916
Why does this bit on your neck
bulge like a rope?

1230
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,833
That's what happens
when you touch fire, Bird.

1231
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:07,041
You touched fire, Mum?

1232
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:09,916
Birdy, fire touched me.

1233
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,291
That's why I tell you to obey.

1234
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,750
I was once willful, too,

1235
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:20,000
and my father showed me
how he felt about that with the iron.

1236
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:25,083
So when you try to bend
the ways of the world,

1237
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:28,875
I cheer for you, Birdy,
but I fear for you.

1238
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,208
To see you hurt, I could not sustain that.

1239
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:34,833
I would rather see you settled
than seared.

1240
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:41,125
There are worse fathers than yours.

1241
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:43,208
But what of husbands, Mother?

1242
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,708
The man I'm meant to marry.

1243
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,625
Well...

1244
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:54,375
I believe that he will protect you

1245
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:57,000
and that he will see
the goodness in your eyes

1246
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:59,666
and that will bring out
the goodness in his.

1247
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:03,500
I have to believe that.

1248
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,250
Enter.

1249
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:09,083
Mama, I require your... your counsel.

1250
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:11,708
But I will wait until your bed
is free of fleas.

1251
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:14,458
Children, please,
let us leave behind our childhood teasing

1252
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:18,083
and act as a family whilst we still can.

1253
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,083
Does my heart a great deal of good.

1254
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,750
Yes, Robert.

1255
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:25,666
I, uh, have word from Gloucestershire.

1256
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,000
- Gloucestershire?
- Aelis.

1257
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,625
Indeed.

1258
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:30,125
"The child husband is dead."

1259
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:31,458
Dead?

1260
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,416
"Fever. Oh, Little Bird,

1261
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,375
everyone cries, but I cry with joy,
for I am coming home."

1262
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,791
The message was mine! Pass it.

1263
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,708
Life can be very cruel, my loves.

1264
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,708
She said they buried
his turnip-head doll beside him.

1265
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:46,416
Birdy.

1266
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,000
Mother, um, do you...

1267
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:51,166
You know, c-could I...

1268
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:56,833
You did well to not lose hope that you
might find your own love, my chick-a-loo.

1269
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,416
What is going on here?

1270
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,333
I do not like to be on the wrong end
of secrets, Mother.

1271
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:10,375
Birdy, your brother
has long harbored hopes

1272
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:13,458
that he might propose to Aelis.

1273
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:16,125
- Aelis?
- Aelis.

1274
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:17,208
Aelis, yeah.

1275
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,708
That Robert?

1276
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:19,916
Mm-hmm.

1277
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,333
- My Aelis?
- Mm.

1278
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:22,666
No, no, no, no.

1279
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,541
Sh-She's not just your Aelis.

1280
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:27,125
She's my Aelis, too.
She's everyone's Aelis.

1281
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:30,208
I mean, she's... she-she's like Jesus.

1282
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:32,083
You know, she's like springtime.

1283
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:35,375
Really like Jesus, 'cause sh...
'cause she-she would sacrifice anything.

1284
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:38,250
She's got really long hair,
and she's-she's really clean.

1285
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,833
And I... I mean,
I would be so happy if-if,

1286
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,625
you know, when I ask her to marry me
and stuff, if she... if she said yes.

1287
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,500
And I-I would consider myself a man

1288
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:50,833
completely reformed, different, reborn...

1289
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:54,375
...and I would be very, very happy.

1290
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:55,791
She's nothing like you.

1291
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:59,250
<i>Well, I guess I don't know everything.</i>

1292
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,708
<i>I think by sneaking, spying
and ensorcelling,</i>

1293
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:05,250
<i>I can avoid surprises,
but they come anyway.</i>

1294
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:09,083
<i>Sometimes in the form of unexpected love.</i>

1295
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:11,500
Ah, you're a beautiful horse,
Belvedere. You are.

1296
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,791
<i>It is a good day, for I head to Aelis's</i>

1297
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:18,083
<i>and we can rejoice in the news
that we are now and finally sisters.</i>

1298
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:21,625
<i>I bring a "welcome to the family" gift
of preserves from the kitchen</i>

1299
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:24,083
<i>and a comb for her beautiful hair.</i>

1300
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:26,541
<i>I once caught Morwenna
staring at this driver</i>

1301
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:29,375
<i>while he washed blood
from a boil on his thigh.</i>

1302
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:33,458
<i>She calls him Golden Tiger
when she speaks of him in secret.</i>

1303
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,458
<i>Imagine life with a peasant.</i>

1304
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:41,041
<i>So simple, so passionate, so...</i>

1305
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,583
<i>toothless.</i>

1306
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:47,541
Birdy!

1307
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,541
- Whoa.
- Aelis!

1308
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,333
Thank you.

1309
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:54,875
Aelis!

1310
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:57,000
Why are you all standing
in the road like cattle?

1311
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,250
Whatever's the emergency?

1312
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,125
Aelis, what's the matter?
It's a happy day.

1313
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,208
You're going to be married.
We are to be sisters.

1314
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,541
- Why are you crying?
- Young Catherine,

1315
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:11,708
please tell your drunk of a father
that his offer is offensive.

1316
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:14,000
Oh, she is not one of your...
your hunting dogs.

1317
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:16,250
The ones that you pay for
in gold bricks. She...

1318
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,500
she is a girl, just as I once was.

1319
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,208
Shut up, shut up, Berenice!

1320
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:23,208
I grow so tired of your voice.

1321
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:24,458
Well, I grew weary of yours.

1322
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,708
Please!
Can we please stop shouting, please?

1323
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:30,041
There do seem to be
a lot of raised voices.

1324
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:33,416
I always say,
"Talk like butter, not knives."

1325
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,333
And whomst are you?

1326
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:38,125
My daughter is a virgin,

1327
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:41,333
confirmed by exam,

1328
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,375
and can command more than twice

1329
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:49,541
the pitiful marriage purse
your father proposes. Hmm.

1330
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:53,208
They pay more for virgins?

1331
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,375
Aelis, they pay more for vir...

1332
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,541
You men are not God. You don't...

1333
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:04,166
You don't get to decide who we are,
where we go

1334
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,666
or how much we cost
like we're just things.

1335
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,583
We're not things! We're people!

1336
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,750
And we can think and we can hear
and we can feel!

1337
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,708
And you just broke
my best friend's heart... your daughter...

1338
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:15,958
Because of your greed.

1339
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,666
Insolent.

1340
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,000
Whelp.

1341
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:21,000
What difference does that make?

1342
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:26,458
A young girl's master merely changes
from father to husband.

1343
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,333
- Can we move?
- Where to?

1344
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:29,791
Rutherford.

1345
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:31,458
<i>I'm sorry, Aelis.</i>

1346
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,708
<i>I want to save you.
More than anything, I do.</i>

1347
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:36,916
- You fly, Birdy.
- Birdy! Birdy!

1348
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,666
Do you see?

1349
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,500
You, get inside.
Get inside and straight to your room.

1350
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:45,458
<i>I am all out of tricks, it seems.</i>

1351
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:47,791
<i>Well, all but one.</i>

1352
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,458
Birdy?

1353
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:53,833
<i>I have convinced Golden Tiger
to give me his clothes</i>

1354
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:56,958
<i>so that I can run to the only place
I think they might see me</i>

1355
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:59,750
<i>as more than a shiny gold coin.</i>

1356
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:01,625
Hey! Nice dress.

1357
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:04,375
- Give us a twirl!
- No.

1358
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,125
<i>Uncle George is a hero,</i>

1359
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:15,000
<i>and mayhap he can tell me
how to be one myself.</i>

1360
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:18,750
<i>Not just in fantasies but in real life.</i>

1361
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:29,083
We've nothing for you, peasant boy.

1362
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:32,416
No, Uncle George, it is I, Catherine.

1363
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,041
No, no, no, no, no,
you've got to peel it first.

1364
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:38,166
- Just like this?
- Yes.

1365
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,916
Now smell.

1366
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,916
Mmm.

1367
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,791
Oh.

1368
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,708
- It's delicious.
- Mmm!

1369
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,458
It is delicious.

1370
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:51,791
I tasted my first orange upon my father's
return from the Moorish country.

1371
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,916
Well, I should definitely like to go
to the Moorish country.

1372
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,791
You'd like to go anywhere
your father isn't.

1373
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,166
We have a baby due any day.

1374
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,708
I am to marry Shaggy Beard.

1375
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,541
Of Lithgow?

1376
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,250
It is he.

1377
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,541
Oh, Birdy...

1378
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:14,291
I knew it would be someone of note,
but I did not think that sort of note.

1379
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:19,916
Lord Murgaw keeps a fine house, you know.

1380
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,291
He'll keep you well.

1381
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:24,125
He owns three small towns

1382
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:25,833
and a leper colony.

1383
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:29,083
Oh, perhaps you can keep an arboretum.

1384
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:31,333
George himself keeps a garden of plants
beloved by Christ.

1385
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:33,541
It's barely a garden, my love.

1386
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,041
It's a place to smoke my pipe in peace.

1387
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,875
Thus far, only the crows, I think,
are impressed with my green fingers.

1388
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:41,833
Oh, the crows adore George.

1389
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,958
My love, I must retire.

1390
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:45,666
I've only just arrived.

1391
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,041
I tire easily these days, Bird.

1392
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:51,041
My back stoops, and my stomach bloats.

1393
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,333
In the morning, I'll deliver you back
to Stone bridge.

1394
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:55,041
Uncle George?

1395
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:58,166
Will you tuck me in?

1396
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,750
All right. You blow out the candle.

1397
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:06,000
No, I want you to tell me a story.

1398
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,166
Please.

1399
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:13,541
I don't think I know any stories.

1400
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:15,791
You've traveled the world.

1401
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,791
You've seen the ocean.
You must know stories.

1402
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:21,333
Ah, but I did not keep a little book
like you do, Bird.

1403
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:24,041
So all the stories have slipped
through my fingers like snow

1404
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,833
when I try to take them home.

1405
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,791
Uncle George?

1406
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:30,500
Hmm?

1407
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:36,208
If you're a hero,
then why did you not try and save me?

1408
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,291
Save you?

1409
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,916
From Shaggy Beard.

1410
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
From my future.

1411
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:47,791
But, you see, Bird...

1412
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,583
I'm not a hero.

1413
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,041
Can you forgive me...

1414
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:01,000
my sweet girl?

1415
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:05,833
Heroes are only in storybooks.

1416
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:10,500
Even the saints only escape by dying.

1417
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:12,708
That doesn't sound
like much fun, either, does it?

1418
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:15,833
Mm. Maybe.

1419
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,208
Do you love Ethelfritha?

1420
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:26,291
As best I know how.

1421
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:29,333
Do you love... me?

1422
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:34,625
Desperately.

1423
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,208
Good night.

1424
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,833
Good night.

1425
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:12,791
Birdy. Birdy, Birdy, Birdy, Birdy.

1426
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:15,166
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1427
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,583
We must go and feed the owls.

1428
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:19,958
- The owls?
- Yes.

1429
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,708
- We've got owls!
- You-you've got...

1430
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:24,166
We have to hurry.

1431
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,166
- You have owls?
- Yes.

1432
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,666
Whoa.

1433
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,083
I keep birds.

1434
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:35,208
But mine are very small.
They're not big like this.

1435
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,166
These are more than birds. They're...

1436
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,583
- They're creatures.
- They're beautiful.

1437
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:39,833
Yes.

1438
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:43,666
I am a creature, too, you know.

1439
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,833
Are you a creature?

1440
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:48,958
Yes.

1441
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:57,083
Shaggy Beard, hmm?

1442
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:58,625
It is not fair.

1443
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:01,750
You're right, Birdy.

1444
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:04,125
It is not fair.

1445
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,250
You should not have to marry him.

1446
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:08,708
- No, I should not.
- Or be a lady.

1447
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,500
I hate being a lady.

1448
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:14,791
Perhaps... we could run away.

1449
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,541
We?

1450
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:18,125
Yes.

1451
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,500
I'm rich. You're young.

1452
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:22,916
Together we could have it all.

1453
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,875
Let's make our way to Arabia.

1454
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:27,375
Arabia?

1455
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:31,125
Taste the orange straight from the tree.

1456
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:36,083
- Have you ever met a lion?
- No.

1457
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,416
A sultan?

1458
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:41,500
You could slay a sultan and take his gold!

1459
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:42,750
Yes!

1460
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,875
- Yes, I would.
- Yes!

1461
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,541
- Definitely.
- Oh, Birdy!

1462
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:51,125
Oh, Birdy, Birdy.

1463
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,625
What?

1464
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,333
I would miss Morwenna, my nurse.

1465
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:01,291
You silly girl, you're too big for nurses.

1466
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:04,791
And I'd miss Perkin, my dearest friend.

1467
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:08,166
Friend? Who needs friends when...
wh-when you have adventure and...

1468
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,750
At least if I was in Lithgow,
I could visit home.

1469
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:14,166
- But...
- I could check on my mother.

1470
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:16,791
I could sleep in my own bed at Christmas.

1471
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:20,833
If we went on a big adventure,
I wouldn't be reunited with Aelis,

1472
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:23,208
and I wouldn't see the baby grow.

1473
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:28,041
- They'd miss me, wouldn't they?
- Yes.

1474
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:32,875
They would... they'd miss me, Birdy.

1475
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:55,541
Uncle George,
next time a peasant raps on your door,

1476
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:57,625
will you please give them
something to eat?

1477
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,708
Bye, Birdy.

1478
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,625
Bye, Uncle George.

1479
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,083
Birdy.

1480
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:28,666
You pest, you rat!

1481
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,416
We were so afraid.

1482
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,500
Golden Tiger arrived late last night
wearing your cape, crying.

1483
01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:37,000
- Morwenna, Morwenna, do not weep.
- Oh...

1484
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:38,625
- Do not weep.
- Birdy.

1485
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:41,291
When you do,
you puff up and resemble a roast beef.

1486
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:44,208
Oh!

1487
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:48,166
My Bird.

1488
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,625
It is your mother.

1489
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:56,958
Push more still, Lady Aislinn!

1490
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:00,166
- Right. Here's the basket.
- Gather your strength yet!

1491
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,666
Mama?

1492
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,958
Is she crowning?

1493
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:05,708
Mama, it's your Birdy. I am back.

1494
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:08,250
- Mama, I'm back.
- Birdy, come away.

1495
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,916
She cannae hear you just now.

1496
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,416
Mama, I promise I'll always be the person
you want me to... you want me to be.

1497
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,041
A crown!

1498
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,916
The skull too big to pass.

1499
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:20,750
- Nothing can be done.
- I can do it.

1500
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:22,958
Father, you must baptize.
Now! Bless them both.

1501
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,375
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1502
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,833
- Stop it!
- ...hallowed be thy name.

1503
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,250
- Stop it! I can do it!
- Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

1504
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,166
on earth as it is in heaven.

1505
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,750
Give us this day our daily bread...

1506
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:42,500
Did I hear you're-you're just giving up?

1507
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:44,041
We have tried all there is to try.

1508
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:46,625
The baby's stuck deep within her hips.

1509
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:50,041
No! No! Doubters! Doubters! All of you!

1510
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,958
- In the name...
- Shut up!

1511
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:54,958
Midwife, you will stay,

1512
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:59,750
And you will not sleep
until our baby is delivered forth safely.

1513
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:02,791
I will not lose another... another child.

1514
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:06,708
Do you hear me?
And I will not lose my holy wife.

1515
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:09,250
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

1516
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:10,833
Yes.

1517
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,666
Thank you. We don't need you.

1518
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,000
Get out. Get out, and don't come back.

1519
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:17,041
Go get some more boiling water
and some more rags.

1520
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:18,708
- And some butter.
- My darling.

1521
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:20,791
My darling, my brave...

1522
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:23,000
beautiful darling, look at me.

1523
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:25,083
- You must look at me. You are so strong.
- Rollo, if this...

1524
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:28,041
if this is meant to be,
then it's meant to be,

1525
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,208
and if it is not, I ask you one thing.

1526
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:33,416
Can you make sure our children
find their place in this world?

1527
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,208
And not just any place; their place.

1528
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,500
Listen to me. Look at me. Look at me.

1529
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,291
Look at me.

1530
01:26:41,416 --> 01:26:43,708
All that I am is us.

1531
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:46,708
All that I could be, you already are.

1532
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:50,416
You're so strong. You're so wise.

1533
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,666
You're so powerful.

1534
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:56,625
You're so grumpy in the mornings.

1535
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:59,625
You're so... you're so close to God

1536
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:03,875
without even having to utter his name.

1537
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,333
I want to make you laugh
and make you safe.

1538
01:27:07,416 --> 01:27:10,416
And I'm not gonna live in a world
where our children's children

1539
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,166
don't get to make you laugh

1540
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:16,000
when they tumble in the grass
in front of us when we're old.

1541
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:18,916
Huh? Can you try?

1542
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,416
If you try, then I'll try, too.

1543
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,250
Don't stand idle, please.

1544
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,125
Get a doctor. Get a doctor.

1545
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,125
Get two doctors.

1546
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,208
Get three!

1547
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:30,500
Take the rope.

1548
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:33,375
You're so strong.

1549
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,125
Got it?

1550
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:39,125
Yes.

1551
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,375
Come on, darling.

1552
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:12,208
Hi, angel.

1553
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:14,041
Aw.

1554
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:16,333
<i>Our baby was born last evening.</i>

1555
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:19,666
<i>A dear, beautiful, scrawny little girl.</i>

1556
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,708
<i>In fact, two of them.</i>

1557
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:27,750
<i>My father, for all his bellowing
about sons, is floating on air.</i>

1558
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:31,166
<i>Which brings me to the strangest words
I have ever said:</i>

1559
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:33,041
<i>"Thank you," to my father.</i>

1560
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:36,708
<i>The most unlikely agent of a miracle
that I know.</i>

1561
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:47,666
<i>We will call them
Eleanor and Mary Catherine.</i>

1562
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:51,041
<i>Proper yet lovely.</i>

1563
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:54,250
<i>I wish I had more time
to teach them tricks.</i>

1564
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:58,000
You like the stars?

1565
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:00,333
Trying to escape?

1566
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,666
I've spent my whole life trying to escape.

1567
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:11,166
<i>I feel something changed inside of me.</i>

1568
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,333
<i>And just because I cannot be happy</i>

1569
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:16,416
<i>does not mean that I do not wish
happiness for others.</i>

1570
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,541
<i>Joy is infectious, I am learning.</i>

1571
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:22,750
<i>I want to save Aelis,
and I think I know a way,</i>

1572
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:25,041
<i>even if it means sacrifice.</i>

1573
01:29:27,916 --> 01:29:29,916
Is it... is it coins?

1574
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,458
- Yes, Shaggy Beard's.
- Wait, for me?

1575
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:33,958
- Mm-hmm.
- Is it...

1576
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:35,541
Is it enough?
Is it... is it enough, Father?

1577
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,375
Yes, you fool. I counted it.

1578
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,708
Wonderful.
I'll be able to buy my tiger back.

1579
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,458
Yeah, this is enough... get the tiger back.

1580
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:43,750
- Hold on, um...
- Robert, Robert.

1581
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:45,666
- I'm-I'm jesting.
- Oh, you're jesting.

1582
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:48,041
A wedding is forthwith.

1583
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,708
Apparently.

1584
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:52,250
All right.

1585
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:55,416
Well, this means I'm a husband, does it?

1586
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,583
- Well, not yet, but, uh...
- No, I am.

1587
01:29:57,666 --> 01:29:59,541
- It means I'm a husband, so...
- All right.

1588
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:02,125
This is really nice.

1589
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:04,166
It's the first thing you've done for me.

1590
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:08,250
It's fantastic, Father.

1591
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:12,166
Uh...

1592
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:18,958
<i>This was as much for Aelis
as it was for my brother.</i>

1593
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:20,416
<i>Likely more.</i>

1594
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,041
<i>She is safe now.</i>

1595
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,166
<i>I may not be safe with her, but I do know</i>

1596
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,416
<i>that she will walk on my grounds...</i>

1597
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,250
<i>...sleep in my quarters,
watch out for Perkin</i>

1598
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:31,333
<i>and feel something like love.</i>

1599
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:49,250
<i>We are having a wedding
for my Aelis and her Robert.</i>

1600
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:51,916
Yeah!

1601
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:57,750
<i>It may be the last time I ever celebrate,
and so I had better enjoy it.</i>

1602
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:01,916
Aw.

1603
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,791
Come on, Birdy!

1604
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:11,500
- Go, Aelis!
- Birdy!

1605
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:13,500
Ah, there we go.

1606
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,750
Love you, Robert!

1607
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:04,208
<i>One more night in my own bed.</i>

1608
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:07,166
<i>Then Shaggy Beard.</i>

1609
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,708
I'll miss you two.

1610
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,375
<i>Do not cry. Do not cry.</i>

1611
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:23,000
<i>God's thumbs, I'm going to cry.</i>

1612
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,041
Goodbye, Birdy.

1613
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,000
Bye, Birdy.

1614
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:36,875
Love you, Birdy.

1615
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:39,416
Birdy!

1616
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:54,416
Don't let that smelly old man
do what we talked about.

1617
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,166
No.

1618
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,833
Bye.

1619
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,291
Sometimes, as the man of the house,

1620
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:20,375
you have to make very hard decisions.

1621
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:40,458
I seem to have come down
with me yearly hay fever.

1622
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:44,708
I trust you can prepare a proper poultice
for your lordship.

1623
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:48,250
Me health has never been good, Catherine,

1624
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:51,166
but I've always dealt with it
by being pure of habit

1625
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,833
and maintaining a stolid countenance.

1626
01:33:53,916 --> 01:33:59,666
Aye. A regular schedule of cold baths
and requiring that the servants

1627
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:03,208
dust under the wardrobes
to rid the space of impurities.

1628
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:05,541
- -
- ROLLO: Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1629
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:08,208
- My lord?
- My lord, indeed.

1630
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:11,166
I have changed my mind.

1631
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:15,333
Excuse me, lord. I've not heard you
properly, for me allergies.

1632
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,583
I've changed... We've changed my mind.

1633
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:20,791
My mind has been changed.
The girl stays with us.

1634
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:23,291
For the time being.

1635
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:26,333
Frankly, sir, I would burn in hell
for allowing my daughter

1636
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:29,000
to spend her life with a man as rank

1637
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,958
and uniformly uncompelling as yourself.

1638
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:34,583
She would die of boredom, and furthermore,

1639
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:38,208
you resemble a bear who has attempted
union with our local locksmith.

1640
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:39,916
It cannot be.

1641
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:43,375
- Out of the carriage, Birdy.
- Stay there!

1642
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:46,958
Sir, you have spent the dowry
that I gave you,

1643
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:49,500
so I do not see what more
we have to discuss.

1644
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:52,833
I am walking back up that path
with my own daughter on my own arm.

1645
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:58,041
If you want Lady Catherine...

1646
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,875
we will duel, sir.

1647
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,791
Well, that seems fair. A duel.

1648
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:04,333
A duel... that's what... that's what we do.

1649
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:06,125
Let me... let me think. Yes.

1650
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:07,916
Right, a duel.

1651
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,125
<i>Am I to believe that
my father plans to fight this man,</i>

1652
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:13,166
<i>swordplay being a skill
he does not possess,</i>

1653
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:15,541
<i>- in order to keep me...</i>
- Yep.

1654
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:18,125
<i>...his greatest pest from having to marry?</i>

1655
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:21,875
Robert, get my-my... duel accoutrements.

1656
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:22,958
Right.

1657
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:25,333
- Etienne, me sword.
- Yes, my sweet lord.

1658
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:27,333
We're having a duel, everybody!

1659
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:29,166
Duel!

1660
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,500
- So, duel to the... to the death or...
- Aye.

1661
01:35:31,583 --> 01:35:35,125
- Yep.
- And if, by some miracle, you do not die,

1662
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:38,666
I promise you
life-changing injuries today, sir.

1663
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,500
Thank you.

1664
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,541
Duel! Duel! Duel! Duel! Duel!

1665
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:51,125
If this duel is won by I,
Lord Rollo of Stone bridge,

1666
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:54,291
then you will return our lady.

1667
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:57,375
And if it is won by I, Sir Murgaw

1668
01:35:57,458 --> 01:36:00,583
of more villages than I can name
in one earthly breath,

1669
01:36:00,666 --> 01:36:03,166
I shall be leaving with my bride.

1670
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:07,208
- Someone say, "Go."
- Go!

1671
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:11,833
Go on, Father!

1672
01:36:13,666 --> 01:36:14,666
Aah!

1673
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,791
Father! Father?

1674
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:18,625
Rollo.

1675
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:21,416
Father?

1676
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:25,125
It's all right. It's all right, Robert.

1677
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:28,416
<i>I am too afraid to speak, but if I could,</i>

1678
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,916
<i>I would tell you not to lose blood for me.</i>

1679
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,333
<i>You have Mama and the babies
to look after.</i>

1680
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:37,541
<i>Be careful, Father.</i>

1681
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:52,291
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Come on, you have him! You have him now!

1682
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:56,583
Oh, me back's gone!

1683
01:36:56,666 --> 01:36:59,000
Me back! Me back's gone. Me back's gone.

1684
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:01,958
I have a case of severe spinal weakening.

1685
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:04,916
It tingles. It tingles, sir.

1686
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,375
- Pause. Pause.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1687
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:10,625
There is no clause to pause
for spinal weakening, lord.

1688
01:37:11,916 --> 01:37:14,208
It's called losing, my friend.

1689
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:16,375
It is not a defeat, sir.

1690
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,000
I am retired hurt.

1691
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,416
We shall be leaving forthwith.

1692
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,708
Don't you dare!

1693
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:22,166
Mama?

1694
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,750
Not without giving us back our lady,
you're not!

1695
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:25,916
Birdy?

1696
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,916
- Give us back our lady!
- Give us back Birdy!

1697
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,250
- Birdy! Birdy!
- Give us back Birdy!

1698
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:39,416
Give us back our lady!

1699
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,166
Give us back our lady! Give us back Birdy!

1700
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:48,333
Birdy!

1701
01:37:48,416 --> 01:37:50,541
Yeah!

1702
01:37:57,208 --> 01:38:00,583
<i>If I've inherited
a bit of my father's heart,</i>

1703
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:03,708
<i>I suppose I shall leave it
here in my chest.</i>

1704
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:16,791
Bye, Juniper.

1705
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:19,500
<i>I will never fully fathom
what my father did for me.</i>

1706
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:24,541
<i>What any father should do
for any daughter...</i>

1707
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:25,750
Goodbye, Breadberry.

1708
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:27,000
<i>...but rarely does.</i>

1709
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:29,208
<i>Better late than never.</i>

1710
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:34,000
Goodbye, Sir Neal.

1711
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:36,000
Sir Neal.

1712
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:38,041
<i>I wish I could help every girl
in the world,</i>

1713
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,791
<i>but for now, I am enough.</i>

1714
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:42,666
Goodbye, Lard Turd.

1715
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:46,791
My favorite.

1716
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:48,791
But don't tell Breadberry.

1717
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,333
<i>And I know he has not granted me a pardon,</i>

1718
01:39:01,416 --> 01:39:04,291
<i>only a reprieve from the most ungodly
beast of marriage,</i>

1719
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:08,625
<i>but my father will find that my gratitude
does not mean I have lost my fight.</i>

1720
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:16,291
<i>It is in this field I raged and dreamed
and met Aelis in secret</i>

1721
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:18,375
<i>and cried over Uncle George</i>

1722
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:22,333
<i>and over the fate
I have been able to trick just a bit.</i>

1723
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:26,291
<i>This is the goat farm where I met Perkin
when I was but a babe,</i>

1724
01:39:26,375 --> 01:39:29,000
<i>hiding from Morwenna's silly slap.</i>

1725
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,875
<i>And here is where the smell of bread
is so strong</i>

1726
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,125
<i>it makes me want to eat
the whole entire world</i>

1727
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:37,041
<i>as if it were a mere loaf.</i>

1728
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:41,708
<i>And someday I will take my little sisters
to the tippy-top of the village,</i>

1729
01:39:41,791 --> 01:39:43,791
<i>and I will say, "Run, little girls.</i>

1730
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:47,416
<i>Lift your skirts and run
for everyone to see."</i>

1731
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:12,708
Golden Tiger...

1732
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,291
I've been waiting, hoping,

1733
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:19,583
dreaming of this moment.

1734
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:21,916
Letters make words, words make...

1735
01:40:25,416 --> 01:40:29,291
<i>Someday this journal
will belong to my sisters.</i>

1736
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:32,458
<i>The two of you can see what I made
of becoming a woman.</i>

1737
01:40:32,541 --> 01:40:35,666
<i>It was not much, but it was my own.</i>

1738
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,791
<i>For right now, it's up to you
to decide, Edward.</i>

1739
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:43,833
{\an8}<i>Has writing in this diary made me
more learned or simply cheekier?</i>

1740
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:53,708
- Okay, here.
- Okay, I'm gonna throw it.

1741
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:58,958
<i>Things girls can do:</i>

1742
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:00,875
<i>run in the fields...</i>

1743
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:05,250
<i>...invent original curses, save the day,</i>

1744
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:09,166
<i>pee standing up...
Well, that one was a bit tricky...</i>

1745
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:13,541
<i>And keep fighting,
no matter who may come on horseback.</i>

1746
01:47:56,875 --> 01:48:01,250
Let's party like it's 1299! Yay!
