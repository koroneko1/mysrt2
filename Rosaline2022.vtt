WEBVTT

00:53.875 --> 00:54.875
[sighs]

01:08.625 --> 01:09.625
Romeo?

01:11.375 --> 01:12.375
[grunts]

01:15.667 --> 01:17.333
[grunting]

01:17.833 --> 01:18.833
[sighs]

01:21.833 --> 01:23.917
[moaning]

01:24.500 --> 01:27.125
To gaze upon you is like
drinking from the purest fountain.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.208
[sighs]

01:29.500 --> 01:33.250
The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.333
Oh, Romeo.

01:34.833 --> 01:40.375
Forswear it, sight,
I never saw true beauty until this night.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.833
Uh, Romeo?

01:44.917 --> 01:45.917
Yes, my love?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.500
Why are you talking like that?

01:49.208 --> 01:53.000
Oh, um-- I-- I--
I felt like it sounded romantic.

01:53.542 --> 01:54.792
-Oh.
-Don't you like it?

01:54.875 --> 01:57.458
Um-- Yeah, actually. It's kinda nice.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.750
Then by yonder blessed moon, I vow.
I shall speaketh--

02:00.833 --> 02:03.875
-[yelling] Oh! Okay!
-Uh-- Oh! Oh! [stammers]

02:03.958 --> 02:05.458
-Are you okay?
-I-- No.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.542
-Um…
-Okay.

02:06.625 --> 02:10.750
[grunting, panting]

02:11.250 --> 02:13.125
-I'm okay. I'm okay. Yeah.
-[gasps] Nice.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.708
-God, I missed you.
-I missed you too.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.583
You're the most beautiful woman
in all of Verona.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.458
-Yes, keep talking.
-We're the most perfect pair.

02:19.542 --> 02:20.375
Yes, don't stop.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.458
They will be saying our names
for centuries.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.042
-Oh, what will they say?
-They will say,

02:24.125 --> 02:28.292
"Never were two hearts more destined
to entwine than those of the lovers…"

02:28.375 --> 02:30.417
-Yes. Yes.
-"…Romeo and--"

02:30.500 --> 02:32.542
[father] Rosaline?

02:32.625 --> 02:33.708
-Shit.
-What do we do?

02:33.792 --> 02:35.083
-My father.
-I don't know what to do.

02:35.167 --> 02:36.333
-You need to go. Hide.
-Right.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.792
-Um. [sighs] Um.
-Uh… Oh.

02:39.625 --> 02:40.917
[father] Rosaline!

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
[sighs] Father?

02:46.542 --> 02:48.167
I thought I heard voices.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.875
Oh. [sighs] I was, uh--
I was in the commode.

02:54.458 --> 02:55.583
Talking to yourself?

02:56.292 --> 02:57.292
It helps.

02:58.542 --> 03:00.375
Huh. I have the opposite problem--

03:01.083 --> 03:04.750
[pants, sighs] Sorry. Where were we?

03:05.292 --> 03:06.708
[breathing heavily]

03:07.333 --> 03:08.333
Um…

03:09.333 --> 03:12.208
For I-- Oh,
they were saying our names for centuries.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.833
Except, how can
they say our names for centuries if--

03:15.375 --> 03:17.208
If-- If-- Um, what?

03:18.583 --> 03:20.708
If we'll always be a secret?

03:21.208 --> 03:23.125
We won't. We won't always be a secret.

03:23.208 --> 03:26.042
[sighs] You're a Montague. I'm a Capulet.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.458
Our families have been enemies
for generations.

03:28.542 --> 03:32.458
Rosaline, we will make this work,
I promise.

03:32.542 --> 03:36.958
One day, we will be together forever.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.125
Forever.

03:40.083 --> 03:41.375
[kisses]

03:41.458 --> 03:43.542
-Good night, Romeo.
-Good night, Rosaline.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.917
A thousand times good night. [chuckles]

03:48.000 --> 03:48.958
[Romeo] Nice one!

03:53.458 --> 03:55.583
Romeo and Rosaline.

03:57.667 --> 03:58.667
Hmm.

04:00.208 --> 04:01.625
Does have a nice ring to it.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.417
-[nurse] Rise and shine, love!
-[groans] Romeo.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Oh, another late night, was it?

04:18.083 --> 04:19.792
Oh, bloody hell.

04:20.292 --> 04:21.917
Are you trying to ruin me?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.375
I thought you were cool
with my sneaking around.

04:24.458 --> 04:28.000
Sneaking around? Yes. Getting caught? No.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.875
Cover your tracks, woman, please.

04:30.958 --> 04:31.958
Sorry.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.750
Although… [groans]

04:34.833 --> 04:38.167
If I could date who I wanted to date,
read what I wanted to read,

04:38.250 --> 04:41.083
there wouldn't be so much sneaking around
in the first place.

04:41.167 --> 04:42.167
Would there, Nurse?

04:42.250 --> 04:43.167
So unfair.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.292
Right, well,
I went to nursing school for seven years,

04:46.375 --> 04:47.750
and now this is what I do for a living.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.417
So, yeah, life is unfair.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.250
By the way, that's what I call covert.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.333
[gasps]

04:54.500 --> 04:55.708
Oh, my God.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.750
[gasps] Nurse.

04:57.833 --> 05:00.792
Right, let's get you dressed.
You have lunch at noon.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.417
Noon? Then why did you wake me so early?

05:04.292 --> 05:08.000
[groans] 'Cause your dad wants you
to wear this behemoth again.

05:10.542 --> 05:11.583
[groans]

05:11.667 --> 05:13.667
No, get up, you lazy cow. Come on.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.375
You can't live in this house forever,
Rosaline.

05:16.458 --> 05:20.167
Your sisters are all off and married,
and now it's your turn.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.583
I'm too young to get married.

05:21.667 --> 05:22.958
-Too young?
-Yeah.

05:23.042 --> 05:24.042
Look at you.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.875
You're almost too old.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.542
Your mother had three kids
when she was your age.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.333
And don't you think she wanted more,
Father?

05:31.417 --> 05:34.083
Of course she did. That's why we had you.

05:35.792 --> 05:38.958
[old suitor]
So, your father's told me all about you.

05:39.042 --> 05:43.000
He even said that you wanted a career.
Is that right?

05:43.083 --> 05:45.167
Yeah, I intend to be a cartographer.

05:45.250 --> 05:49.167
A cartographer? [laughs]

05:49.250 --> 05:51.292
That-- That's adorable.

05:51.792 --> 05:55.042
[stammers]
My third wife had an ambition once.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.250
Didn't care for it on her.

05:57.333 --> 05:58.458
Mother of God.

05:58.542 --> 06:01.500
But she wasn't as pretty as you are.
[slurps]

06:02.792 --> 06:03.792
You know--

06:04.375 --> 06:05.375
[slurps]

06:05.458 --> 06:09.292
If my father told you so much about me,
Mr. Danieli…

06:11.167 --> 06:13.042
…he must have mentioned Josephine.

06:13.542 --> 06:15.000
Wherever I go, she goes.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.125
-Oh.
-[Rosaline] Yeah.

06:17.625 --> 06:21.250
Well-- Well,
when do I get to meet this Josephine?

06:21.333 --> 06:22.333
What do you mean?

06:23.417 --> 06:24.875
She's sitting right there.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.500
Josephine! No!
Take that out of your mouth right now!

06:31.583 --> 06:34.333
Take it! Put it down!
We've been over this!

06:39.083 --> 06:41.042
[Mr. Danieli breathing heavily]

06:41.583 --> 06:42.750
[sighs]

06:44.333 --> 06:47.625
Just… wasn't into me, I guess.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.333
Ah, that's right.
You wanna marry for love.

06:54.417 --> 06:55.750
Is there any other reason?

06:56.250 --> 07:01.125
Mmm. Money, status, land,
nicer living quarters.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.250
No, no other reason.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.333
[street chatter]

07:04.417 --> 07:05.833
We get one life, Paris.

07:06.333 --> 07:11.500
I want mine to be different.
I want romance, passion, adventure.

07:11.583 --> 07:12.708
Mm-hmm.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.417
And this mystery boy, he gives you that?

07:16.292 --> 07:18.125
Mm-hmm.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.625
What?

07:19.708 --> 07:23.500
I just wonder if all this sneaking around
is adding to the attraction.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.083
Because, in my experience,

07:25.167 --> 07:29.000
I've often found that it's pretty easy
to mistake danger and drama

07:29.083 --> 07:30.750
for romantic passion.

07:30.833 --> 07:33.250
But also, I mean,
who doesn't love a secret?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.958
To live in a world of your own making,
just the two of you.

07:36.042 --> 07:41.250
[continues speaking indistinctly]

07:47.875 --> 07:49.750
Uh-- Okay.

07:49.833 --> 07:51.542
[pedestrian] Romeo! Hey, man.

07:52.292 --> 07:53.292
Come on.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.292
Stand back, coz!

08:17.292 --> 08:18.208
[groans]

08:18.292 --> 08:21.792
You're surrounded by Montagues.

08:21.875 --> 08:25.208
You might catch something.

08:25.292 --> 08:26.583
They weren't even doing anything.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.917
Not yet, they weren't.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.042
We don't want any trouble, Tybalt.

08:31.125 --> 08:35.042
[slurred] "Oh, we don't want any trouble,
Tybalt." [laughs]

08:35.125 --> 08:39.000
Then, you should go back to
your side of town where you belong.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.708
Why don't you and your, uh,
boy band meet us there?

08:41.792 --> 08:43.083
Maybe we will.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.000
You're welcome there any time.

08:45.083 --> 08:48.708
How about I welcome my fist to your face?

08:49.208 --> 08:53.917
I don't know what that means.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.417
It means I'm going to punch you!

08:56.500 --> 09:00.667
-[both grunting]
-[people on street] Oh! Whoa!

09:00.750 --> 09:06.792
[both grunting]

09:06.875 --> 09:09.833
-Ho! Oh, oh, oh! [breathes heavily]
-Okay. Okay. All right. All right.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.167
You all have big swords.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.167
How about putting them
back in your pants now, yeah?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.583
Come on. Let's go.

09:19.583 --> 09:23.167
-[sighs]
-[Romeo] Benvolio, Mercutio, let's go.

09:24.167 --> 09:27.833
Girl, that is one tasty Montague.

09:27.917 --> 09:29.250
Can I tell you a secret?

09:30.750 --> 09:34.792
[moaning, kissing]

09:36.000 --> 09:37.042
[chuckles]

09:38.375 --> 09:39.417
[sighs]

09:42.125 --> 09:43.292
For you.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.375
[gasps]

09:45.208 --> 09:46.667
[Romeo] I engraved it myself.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.792
[Rosaline gasps, sighs]

09:49.958 --> 09:51.708
I shall wear it always.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.333
Okay.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.083
[sighs]

09:58.875 --> 09:59.958
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

10:01.417 --> 10:03.208
I'm sorry about my cousin.

10:03.292 --> 10:04.500
Oh, well, you know…

10:04.583 --> 10:07.167
I just wish we could live far,
far away from here.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.000
Where would we live?

10:09.083 --> 10:10.375
On a mountaintop.

10:10.458 --> 10:11.333
In a cabin.

10:11.417 --> 10:12.542
-Made of wood.
-[sighs]

10:12.625 --> 10:15.500
Kinda sounds perfect.
I could write poetry all day.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.375
Oh, you'll be such a gifted poet.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.500
You could keep the house
and watch the children.

10:19.583 --> 10:20.583
Yes.

10:22.458 --> 10:23.792
Wait. What?

10:23.875 --> 10:25.167
-Hmm?
-[chuckles]

10:25.667 --> 10:30.750
Uh, sorry. While you're off writing verse,
I'm home changing diapers?

10:31.750 --> 10:34.750
[stammers] Well,
the point is that we would be together…

10:35.750 --> 10:41.250
in public, away from our families
and-and-and all of this hate.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.750
-Right.
-Yeah.

10:44.833 --> 10:45.958
-Right.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

10:46.042 --> 10:48.417
Yes. Okay. Okay. [chuckles]

10:50.292 --> 10:51.333
I love you.

10:55.750 --> 10:59.250
Do you love me too?

11:04.500 --> 11:05.667
-Oh.
-It's just--

11:05.750 --> 11:06.583
-Fine.
-Sorry.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.375
I-- I-- I wasn't expecting that.
It's just no one's ever really…

11:09.458 --> 11:11.125
I should probably go. Um--

11:11.208 --> 11:15.958
I-- I, um-- There's the guards, like,
everywhere tonight, so it's not safe.

11:16.042 --> 11:16.875
No. [stammers]

11:16.958 --> 11:20.292
I'm just-- Just get going
so I don't get captured by the guards.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.500
Romeo, wait. The Capulet Ball is tomorrow.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.167
Rosaline, you know
I can't be seen at any Capulet ga--

11:26.250 --> 11:27.833
It's a masquerade ball.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.917
We could dance together,
and no one will know that it's us.

11:36.542 --> 11:37.542
I'll be there.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.333
Great. I can't wait.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.500
A thousand times can't wait? [chuckles]

11:45.542 --> 11:47.792
[Rosaline] I've been waiting for him to
say those words.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.417
And then he finally does,
and I just freeze like an idiot.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.833
I don't know what's wrong with me, Nurse.

11:53.917 --> 11:55.708
There's nothing wrong with you, chicken.

11:55.792 --> 11:59.625
They're not easy words to say.
You know, unless you mean them.

12:00.125 --> 12:01.625
I-- Of course I mean them.

12:01.708 --> 12:03.375
-That beak all right?
-Yes.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.542
[sighs] It's okay.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.750
Tonight, I'll make it up to him.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.958
We'll dance. We'll sing. We'll kiss.

12:10.042 --> 12:11.750
Everything will be back to normal.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.500
I have wonderful news.

12:13.583 --> 12:17.292
Just when we thought we had run out of
eligible bachelors in Verona,

12:17.375 --> 12:19.792
a family has arrived from the north.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.750
The Penzas.

12:21.833 --> 12:27.542
And lucky for us, they have a son
who has just returned from the war intact.

12:28.083 --> 12:30.125
Wonderful! You marry him.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.917
[knocking]

12:32.000 --> 12:33.250
That must be him.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.125
Wait.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.958
-[stammers] Now?
-Now.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.708
[Rosaline]
I'd rather eat rotten goat innards!

12:38.792 --> 12:40.667
[father] I have
a really good feeling. No, Rosaline.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.708
[Rosaline] I'd rather bathe in the filth
of ten thousand mules.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.833
-[father] Just give him a chance.
-[Rosaline] No.

12:44.917 --> 12:45.917
[father] Rosaline.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
[Rosaline] How many times
do I have to tell you, Father?

12:48.083 --> 12:50.333
I don't want an arranged marriage.

12:50.417 --> 12:55.000
I wanna travel the world,
be free, have adventures,

12:55.083 --> 12:57.208
and with someone that I actually love.

12:57.292 --> 12:58.625
[father] You're a woman.

12:58.708 --> 13:01.083
You're not supposed to talk about
what you want.

13:03.833 --> 13:04.833
[grunts]

13:05.708 --> 13:11.167
Dario Penza, may I present to you
my beautiful daughter, Rosaline.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.000
[clicks tongue, sighs]

13:14.542 --> 13:15.667
Hello.

13:15.750 --> 13:18.000
[scoffs] Whatever.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.083
Have a good time.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.458
Shall we? [sighs]

13:30.292 --> 13:31.292
[sighs]

13:35.875 --> 13:37.292
[sighs]

13:37.375 --> 13:40.875
-So, how do you like living in Ver--
-Let me stop you right there, soldier boy.

13:41.375 --> 13:42.375
-Soldier boy?
-Now, granted,

13:42.458 --> 13:45.583
you are a big step up
from the toothless octogenarians

13:45.667 --> 13:47.833
my father usually tries to pawn me off on…

13:49.833 --> 13:51.958
but the fact remains:

13:52.042 --> 13:55.958
I have literally no interest in you or in
this whole arranged marriage business.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.500
No matter how many acres of land

13:57.583 --> 13:59.583
or special breed of horse
your father's offering.

13:59.667 --> 14:00.625
Cow.

14:00.708 --> 14:01.708
Excuse me?

14:01.792 --> 14:03.292
He's offering a cow.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.292
That's about it, I'm afraid.
We're not rich.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.625
Well, whoop-de-do.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.708
-[Dario] If I was you, I'd take the deal.
-[Rosaline] Would you?

14:09.792 --> 14:12.958
Yeah. [chuckles]
I have some land, some prospects.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.042
I have all my teeth.

14:15.625 --> 14:16.917
Could do a lot worse.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.042
Well, you're not really my type.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.333
You're not exactly my type either.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.417
Hmm. And what is your type, Suede City?

14:22.500 --> 14:24.500
Oh, my type is not a shrew.

14:25.083 --> 14:25.958
Blow me.

14:27.042 --> 14:28.042
[wheels squeak]

14:28.125 --> 14:31.333
[clears throat] Well, we're here.

14:33.250 --> 14:36.042
Um, what's this now?

14:36.542 --> 14:39.958
Yeah, she's a beaut, isn't she?

14:40.958 --> 14:43.167
[chuckles] Yeah, that's not happening.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.750
And why is that?

14:47.708 --> 14:49.292
I have-- [stammers]

14:49.375 --> 14:51.875
There's-- It's--
It doesn't look safe. Mmm.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.500
I was master helmsman of a six-sail
carrack. I assure you she's plenty safe.

14:55.583 --> 14:56.875
What if there's a storm?

14:56.958 --> 14:58.417
Do you see any storm clouds?

14:58.917 --> 15:02.583
What if I have to go to the bathroom, hmm?

15:06.458 --> 15:08.917
-[huffs]
-Oh. Oh, I see.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.458
-What do you see?
-[chuckles] No, you're afraid.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.750
[chuckles] What?

15:13.833 --> 15:15.542
-No, I'm not.
-I can see it in your face.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.125
No, I am not.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.958
Look at the big tough girl
afraid of the water.

15:20.042 --> 15:22.333
I am not afraid of the [imitates] "water."

15:22.417 --> 15:23.375
That's ridiculous.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.000
[Rosaline scoffs]

15:27.458 --> 15:29.042
[quietly] I'm afraid of the fish.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.375
-All of them?
-[Rosaline] Yeah, it's a real thing.

15:32.458 --> 15:33.917
Ichthyophobia. Look it up.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.583
-All fish?
-[Rosaline] Okay, that's good.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.917
-Oh, this must be a nightmare for you.
-All right, fine. I'll go.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.708
I'll go on your stupid boat.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.042
Fantastic.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.917
[Rosaline] I have somewhere I have to be.
So, 30 minutes max.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.167
-Would you like a hand?
-No!

15:46.250 --> 15:48.833
Okay. Watch out for the-- Sorry.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.375
You got it.

15:57.708 --> 16:02.042
Okay, just-- Whoa. Whoa. Okay.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.292
This is gonna be fun.

16:03.375 --> 16:07.792
[Rosaline scoffs, pants]

16:07.875 --> 16:10.583
[pop song playing]

16:10.667 --> 16:13.042
[people at ball chattering]

16:14.333 --> 16:15.333
[exhales sharply]

16:26.750 --> 16:27.750
Rosaline? No.

16:31.542 --> 16:32.542
Rosaline?

16:34.750 --> 16:35.750
Rosaline?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.042
[pop song stops]

16:41.833 --> 16:43.417
[sighs]

16:50.375 --> 16:51.667
Lucky knife.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.083
Do you hunt?

16:54.417 --> 16:55.542
Yeah, I hunt.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.458
Huh. Yeah, I grew up on a farm
just north of here.

16:58.542 --> 17:02.625
Some chickens, some cows,
a very moody goat.

17:02.708 --> 17:03.542
Yeah.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.792
And my mum,
she taught me how to cook even before I--

17:05.875 --> 17:07.000
I have a boyfriend.

17:09.625 --> 17:10.625
You do?

17:11.833 --> 17:15.875
[sighs] Yeah,
and he's waiting for me right this minute.

17:15.958 --> 17:18.125
So we just really need to be
getting going and--

17:18.208 --> 17:20.500
Your father never mentioned any boyfriend.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.042
He doesn't know. [sighs]

17:25.125 --> 17:27.583
Well, you could've just told me that
in the first place.

17:27.667 --> 17:28.667
We'll get you back.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.208
[wind whistling]

17:34.292 --> 17:36.542
[thunder rumbles]

17:36.625 --> 17:38.083
[sighs] Uh-oh.

17:38.667 --> 17:39.667
Uh-oh?

17:40.625 --> 17:41.917
[rain pattering]

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
[screams]

17:43.875 --> 17:44.875
What?

17:45.375 --> 17:46.375
Oh, my God.

17:46.458 --> 17:47.583
[sighs] What?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.333
We can't go back in this!

17:49.417 --> 17:50.833
We'll have to wait it out!

17:51.833 --> 17:54.000
But we must go back!

17:54.500 --> 17:56.833
-The ball started an hour ago!
-[grunting]

17:56.917 --> 17:58.833
[pop song playing]

17:58.917 --> 18:00.667
[people at ball chattering]

18:05.792 --> 18:06.792
[pop song stops]

18:06.875 --> 18:07.958
[thunder rumbling]

18:08.042 --> 18:10.458
[Dario] You're getting drenched.
Come sit down.

18:10.542 --> 18:12.083
You said it wasn't gonna storm!

18:12.167 --> 18:14.208
I'm a soldier, not a weatherman.

18:15.292 --> 18:16.458
I hope you're happy.

18:16.542 --> 18:17.542
[Dario] I'm not.

18:17.625 --> 18:18.625
[Rosaline pants]

18:19.583 --> 18:21.708
Stop smiling.

18:21.792 --> 18:26.708
[groaning]

18:26.792 --> 18:28.708
[Dario] Yeah, we're going backwards.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.083
[pop song playing]

18:31.167 --> 18:32.542
[people at ball chattering]

18:33.708 --> 18:35.042
-Hey.
-Oh.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.833
Um, I'm so sorry--

18:38.917 --> 18:42.667
I, um, I'm-- No, all right.

18:42.750 --> 18:43.875
Who was that?

18:45.542 --> 18:46.542
[sighs]

18:50.750 --> 18:52.125
[sighs] Great.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.500
-Oh!
-Oh, oh.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.792
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-[stammers] Excuse me.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.292
My-- My bad.

19:05.917 --> 19:06.917
It's okay.

19:14.542 --> 19:17.042
H-Hi. I'm Romeo.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.917
Juliet. [chuckles]

19:30.458 --> 19:31.792
-[pop song ends]
-[thunder rumbles]

19:31.875 --> 19:34.458
[Rosaline] This has literally been
the worst night of my life.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.750
-[Dario] The feeling's more than mutual.
-[sighs]

19:40.667 --> 19:41.667
Thanks for nothing.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.167
Yeah, right there with you.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.833
Actually, the pancetta wasn't terrible,
so thank you for that. But only for that.

19:46.917 --> 19:49.667
Well, you're welcome for that.
But only for that.

19:49.750 --> 19:50.792
Have a nice life!

19:54.042 --> 19:57.167
[panting]

19:57.250 --> 19:58.625
[people at ball chattering]

19:58.708 --> 20:03.292
[panting]

20:25.292 --> 20:30.000
[sighs, pants]

20:36.125 --> 20:37.125
Steve the Courier!

20:39.167 --> 20:40.167
What up?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.667
You did deliver my message this morning,
yes?

20:45.500 --> 20:46.625
Message.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.708
Uh, message.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.250
Message.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.833
Oh, yeah, I-- I think so.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.167
Y-- You think so?

20:56.250 --> 20:57.250
[Steve] I, um--

21:01.167 --> 21:02.292
Steve!

21:02.375 --> 21:05.000
I definitely delivered all the mail.

21:07.417 --> 21:09.375
And there was nothing for me in return?

21:09.458 --> 21:11.708
[Steve] No, no.
Just some letters for your pops.

21:11.792 --> 21:12.917
[Rosaline] That's it?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah, that's it.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.042
[Rosaline] You're-- You're sure?

21:16.542 --> 21:17.625
Yeah, 100%.

21:20.792 --> 21:22.500
[Rosaline] You think he's angry with me?

21:22.583 --> 21:24.042
[nurse] I don't know why he would be.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.458
Do you think he's tired of me?

21:25.542 --> 21:26.958
I'm sure that's not it.

21:27.042 --> 21:28.375
Then why haven't I heard from him?

21:28.458 --> 21:31.292
[inhales deeply] Well,
there is a lot of plague going around.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.833
You think he has plague?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.625
He did look a bit boily.
But it's probably just hormones.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.208
-Oh, my God.
-Rosaline!

21:38.125 --> 21:40.750
Uh, your, um--

21:40.833 --> 21:41.833
Oh, she knows.

21:41.917 --> 21:45.250
Oh. Well, I saw Romeo crossing the bridge,
and he's headed this way.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.083
[chuckling]

21:53.875 --> 21:56.000
[sighs, pants]

22:34.792 --> 22:36.208
Where the hell is he going?

22:52.750 --> 22:54.417
[rock whooshing, thuds on ground]

22:54.500 --> 22:57.667
[dogs barking]

23:01.042 --> 23:02.417
[dog barks]

23:06.125 --> 23:07.958
[panting]

23:12.583 --> 23:14.542
[panting]

23:16.292 --> 23:17.500
[grunts] Whatever.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.875
It's fine. It's fine.

23:20.958 --> 23:22.167
[Romeo speaking indistinctly]

23:22.250 --> 23:24.292
[grunts]
It's not like he can't have friends.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.958
[panting]

23:26.042 --> 23:29.458
[Romeo] Thou art as glorious
as a winged messenger of heaven.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.708
[Rosaline] Except for whoever that is.

23:31.792 --> 23:35.417
The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.042
The fairest stars.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.167
Forswear it, sight.
I never saw true beauty until this night.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.042
Son of a--

23:46.125 --> 23:47.250
[nurse] Madam.

23:48.500 --> 23:54.125
Nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

23:55.958 --> 23:56.958
[Romeo groans]

23:58.958 --> 23:59.958
[kisses]

24:00.667 --> 24:01.667
[sighs]

24:02.750 --> 24:05.542
[Romeo] O, blessed, blessed night!

24:14.625 --> 24:16.125
[hawk cries]

24:32.125 --> 24:37.208
["All By Myself" playing on violin]

24:41.708 --> 24:43.542
Not getting out of bed today either?

24:44.708 --> 24:47.833
-[violin stops]
-[grunting]

24:47.917 --> 24:48.917
Stay out.

24:50.208 --> 24:52.000
Hey, I was listening to that.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.125
It was horrible.

24:53.208 --> 24:54.208
[sighs]

24:54.292 --> 24:56.208
How long is this gonna go on for?

24:56.292 --> 24:58.875
The sun is shining. The air is warm.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.792
A nice long ride will do you good.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.583
I'll call the stables
and have them saddle your horse.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.167
I can't ride the horse.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.375
[nurse] Why not?

25:06.458 --> 25:07.458
I have cholera.

25:07.542 --> 25:09.167
You do not have cholera.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.333
How do you know?

25:10.417 --> 25:13.083
Because I am a registered nurse.

25:13.167 --> 25:15.833
[groans] What's the point?

25:15.917 --> 25:19.333
The point is you can't
lie around in bed all afternoon, chicken.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.750
[scoffs] I'll never love again.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.417
[nurse] I think
you're being rather dramatic, Rosaline.

25:28.583 --> 25:31.583
Nurse, you don't understand.

25:32.167 --> 25:37.208
They were kissing, and-and-and touching,
and-and being all gross.

25:37.292 --> 25:41.375
And he was saying things to her
that he just said to me three days ago.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.333
Mmm.

25:42.417 --> 25:43.792
-Three days.
-Yes.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.417
-Three, Nurse.
-Yes.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.333
[Rosaline] Yet, the worst part is,

25:47.417 --> 25:48.625
it's my fault.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.000
I drove him to her.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.375
[sighs]

25:53.208 --> 25:55.792
If only I'd said "I love you"
when I had the chance.

25:55.875 --> 25:58.042
[knocking]

26:00.333 --> 26:01.917
-[Lord Capulet] This should be fun.
-[Lady Capulet] Oh, please.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.917
[Lord Capulet] Ah, young Rosaline.

26:04.417 --> 26:07.917
Mmm. Uncle Capulet, what a surprise.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Rosaline.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.083
Aunt Lady, welcome.

26:10.167 --> 26:11.458
It's been too long.

26:12.083 --> 26:14.500
Oh, you remember your cousin, Tybalt.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.375
I do.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.958
[Lady Capulet] And our daughter
just returned from school.

26:20.042 --> 26:22.750
Of course! [chuckles] Sweet little…

26:23.417 --> 26:24.417
[giggles]

26:26.792 --> 26:27.792
Juliet.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.833
[sighs, chuckles]

26:29.917 --> 26:32.417
-It's so good to see you, Rosaline.
-[groans]

26:32.500 --> 26:35.583
-[chuckling]
-[chuckles] Ah. Ow.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.250
I think my earring's caught.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.958
-Oh, just, uh, just a little to the left.
-[grunting]

26:40.042 --> 26:42.542
[chuckles] Oh. [chuckles, sighs]

26:42.625 --> 26:45.833
[both chuckling]

26:45.917 --> 26:50.000
-Wow. [chuckles] Wow. You're--
-[chuckling]

26:50.083 --> 26:52.375
All grown up now. I know. [chuckles]

26:52.458 --> 26:53.500
Oh.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.792
The last time I saw you, you had gaps
in your teeth, and you came up to here.

26:56.875 --> 26:59.250
Ah, it really has been a long time.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.792
We have so much to catch up on.

27:01.875 --> 27:06.583
-It's so lovely seeing you. [chuckling]
-[chuckles] Definitely. [chuckles]

27:07.125 --> 27:09.458
Oh, my God. [breathes heavily]

27:14.542 --> 27:16.417
[Lord Capulet]
Surely you know why I'm here, Adrian?

27:16.500 --> 27:19.417
[Adrian] This is your quarrel,
brother, not mine.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.917
[Lord Capulet] It is all our quarrel.
You're a Capulet.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.167
[Adrian] I don't like
the Montagues any more than you do,

27:24.250 --> 27:25.500
but that's why there's laws.

27:25.583 --> 27:27.167
[Lord Capulet]
We've let this get out of hand.

27:27.250 --> 27:30.417
It is up to us
to make this city great again.

27:31.125 --> 27:33.083
Can I say something?

27:33.792 --> 27:37.625
If you really hate the Montagues so much,
you could just move.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.667
I hear Siena is very nice.

27:41.208 --> 27:44.083
You let your daughter speak
at the dinner table?

27:44.167 --> 27:47.750
[Rosaline chuckles] I'm sorry.
I thought this was my house.

27:47.833 --> 27:48.833
[Adrian] Rosaline.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.333
What? I don't go to his house
and tell him how to do things.

27:51.417 --> 27:54.667
[Adrian] Rosaline,
take your cousin out to the garden.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.500
I'm sure you have much to catch up on.

27:56.583 --> 27:58.958
-But Dad, the swan.
-The garden. Rosaline!

27:59.458 --> 28:01.458
-[whispers] Juliet.
-[Adrian] Now.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.292
[chair scrapes]

28:08.833 --> 28:11.083
[smacks lips] Well, that was awkward.

28:14.583 --> 28:15.583
[sighs]

28:21.250 --> 28:23.333
Do you always talk to your dad like that?

28:24.417 --> 28:25.417
Whatever.

28:26.042 --> 28:29.750
[gasps]
God, I can't wait to be old like you.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.917
[both chuckling]

28:33.417 --> 28:35.708
You know, what's your rush?

28:36.375 --> 28:38.417
You won't be young forever, you know?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.583
And what about another year of,
uh, finishing school?

28:41.417 --> 28:42.625
That could be fun.

28:43.750 --> 28:46.375
Oh. [chuckles] I'm pretty finished.

28:47.375 --> 28:48.667
[sighs]

28:48.750 --> 28:49.750
[Rosaline sighs]

28:50.708 --> 28:51.708
Rosaline.

28:53.292 --> 28:54.750
Can I tell you a secret?

28:55.917 --> 28:56.875
[Rosaline sighs]

28:56.958 --> 28:58.292
But you can't tell anyone.

28:59.958 --> 29:00.958
I'm listening.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.083
I'm in love.

29:03.917 --> 29:05.625
-[ball thuds]
-[bird squawks, flutters]

29:06.042 --> 29:07.542
-[sighs]
-I met a boy.

29:08.375 --> 29:09.208
[sighs]

29:09.292 --> 29:13.875
And he is just the most wonderful boy
in the whole world. [chuckles]

29:14.375 --> 29:16.125
I see. [stammers] Um--

29:16.208 --> 29:19.375
Where was it that you met this wonder boy?

29:19.458 --> 29:22.125
Oh, the other night
at the masquerade ball.

29:22.208 --> 29:25.417
And already,
I can't imagine my life without him.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.500
It's time to go.

29:26.583 --> 29:28.083
-[Juliet] He says things to me.
-Excuse me.

29:28.167 --> 29:32.250
Beautiful, romantic things.
You've never heard such poetry.

29:35.708 --> 29:36.792
Let me guess.

29:39.167 --> 29:42.083
He compares you to the moon and the sun.

29:44.125 --> 29:47.250
"The fairest stars in heaven
do entreat your eyes."

29:51.458 --> 29:54.792
-How-- How do you--
-It's Romeo Montague, isn't it?

29:57.792 --> 30:02.792
[breathes shakily]

30:03.333 --> 30:04.333
[Rosaline] Yeah.

30:05.208 --> 30:08.125
Everybody knows Romeo Montague. [chuckles]

30:08.708 --> 30:10.500
[breathes heavily]

30:11.208 --> 30:14.542
I'm afraid you're not the first
young maiden he's charmed with his…

30:16.000 --> 30:19.625
high cheekbones and fancy words.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.208
I'm such a fool.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.708
Yeah, you kind of are.

30:27.875 --> 30:31.250
-[sighs]
-But don't beat yourself up about it.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.750
You know,
it could have happened to anybody.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.750
Did it happen to you?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.542
To me? No, please.

30:40.417 --> 30:44.958
Juliet, you're not even of marrying age.

30:45.042 --> 30:49.708
Why settle down with just one man
when you can, you know, live a little,

30:49.792 --> 30:53.167
play the field,
sample at the buffet of life?

30:54.958 --> 30:56.167
How do I do that?

30:59.042 --> 31:03.042
Well, I could show you, if you want.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.042
You would do that for me?

31:08.625 --> 31:10.042
What are cousins for? [chuckles]

31:10.625 --> 31:11.833
[giggles]

31:11.917 --> 31:15.917
[tavern-goers singing
"It's All Coming Back To Me Now"]

31:19.333 --> 31:21.292
[singing stops, clamors]

31:21.375 --> 31:23.958
Now, who wants to buy us some drinks?

31:24.042 --> 31:27.292
-Me! [yelling]
-Right here! Right here!

31:27.375 --> 31:33.958
[laughs] No. That is just so funny,
because I love sports.

31:34.042 --> 31:37.625
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, jousting, fencing, grappling.

31:37.708 --> 31:40.708
Oh, my God! I am a jouster!

31:40.792 --> 31:42.917
-What? No way!
-[laughs]

31:44.167 --> 31:45.833
Please, let me buy you another drink.

31:45.917 --> 31:47.542
Oh, um. We'll be right back.

31:48.333 --> 31:49.750
[chairs scrape]

31:51.375 --> 31:53.875
Okay. Now you try.

31:53.958 --> 31:56.792
Um, I don't know.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.125
-These men are so…
-Easy?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.208
Stupid!

32:00.875 --> 32:02.208
Why on Earth would I want to spend

32:02.292 --> 32:04.208
the rest of my life
with someone like that?

32:04.292 --> 32:05.292
-Ew.
-[patron belches]

32:05.375 --> 32:09.458
Juliet, you're not here to find someone
to spend your life with.

32:09.542 --> 32:13.583
You're here to just enjoy yourself
at their expense,

32:13.667 --> 32:16.708
and then never see them ever again. Okay?

32:16.792 --> 32:19.125
-Now, get out there and have some fun.
-Oh.

32:20.750 --> 32:21.750
Go on.

32:22.583 --> 32:25.250
Go. Go.

32:26.875 --> 32:27.875
Um.

32:28.625 --> 32:33.667
Uh, your-- your mustache is so thick.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.875
-[patron] Oh, thank you.
-[Juliet giggles]

32:38.167 --> 32:39.417
[patron] Do you wanna have a seat?

32:39.500 --> 32:40.667
[Juliet] May I? [giggles]

32:43.125 --> 32:46.042
Excuse me? Hello?

32:46.625 --> 32:48.333
Hello? Over here!

32:48.417 --> 32:50.250
[stammers] Hi. If-- If you could just--

32:54.000 --> 32:56.958
-How are you, Rosaline?
-Admiral Shit-for-Brains.

32:57.417 --> 32:58.750
-[chuckles]
-[Rosaline] Hello?

33:01.542 --> 33:03.375
I'd like to order a drink, sir.

33:03.458 --> 33:04.500
[whistles]

33:08.833 --> 33:10.042
Thanks.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.458
You know, when I first came to Verona,

33:21.583 --> 33:25.375
I thought the place would be filled with
women looking for a respectable husband.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.667
Turns out, not so much.

33:28.750 --> 33:31.333
Are you the respectable
husband in that scenario?

33:33.875 --> 33:35.875
How is it going with
that boyfriend of yours?

33:35.958 --> 33:38.583
Good. Great, actually.

33:38.667 --> 33:40.833
And is he here? I'd love to meet him.

33:40.917 --> 33:44.083
No, he's-- He's actually busy tonight.

33:44.167 --> 33:45.042
Really?

33:45.125 --> 33:46.667
Dive bars aren't really his scene anyway.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.458
Ah. Shame.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.417
Well, I imagine he's very respectable.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.375
Yeah.

33:52.458 --> 33:57.167
He's witty and smart, writes sonnets,

33:57.250 --> 33:59.333
speaks several different
foreign languages.

33:59.417 --> 34:02.917
You know, just really the opposite of you.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.292
Is that so?

34:07.417 --> 34:08.417
[chuckles]

34:10.792 --> 34:12.500
Well, I will leave you to it then.

34:13.958 --> 34:14.958
You'll be missed.

34:17.708 --> 34:20.500
[in French]

34:32.417 --> 34:35.333
[laughing]

34:35.417 --> 34:38.458
All right. If you'll excuse me, I must go.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.708
Hey, lady. Please,
you must let me see you some time.

34:41.792 --> 34:44.042
[patron] Back off, fella.
She was talking to me.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.375
Okay, bye. [laughs]

34:46.458 --> 34:48.125
[giggling]

34:48.208 --> 34:49.833
-Hey.
-Hi.

34:49.917 --> 34:54.417
Rosaline, I'm having so much fun.
Thank you. [laughs]

34:54.500 --> 34:56.667
Oh! Oh!

34:57.542 --> 34:59.583
-Ow! Oh! Ow!
-Oh.

35:00.083 --> 35:02.583
-[sighs] Not again. It's caught.
-Sorry. [grunts]

35:03.958 --> 35:07.458
[laughs] Every time.

35:08.625 --> 35:09.958
Hmm.

35:10.042 --> 35:12.417
Mmm. Mmm.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.583
And the best part is
you were totally right.

35:14.667 --> 35:17.042
I haven't thought about Romeo once.

35:17.125 --> 35:20.542
Well, in that case,
shall we do it again tomorrow?

35:22.625 --> 35:23.667
Yes.

35:23.750 --> 35:24.667
[chuckles]

35:25.708 --> 35:28.333
[Rosaline] My dearest Romeo.
I haven't heard from you in a while.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.500
[chuckles] I hope you're okay.

35:29.583 --> 35:30.708
-What is your name?
-Oh, it's Juliet.

35:30.792 --> 35:32.083
Nothing much new over here,

35:32.167 --> 35:34.917
except I'm being forced to babysit
my younger cousin,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.708
and she's really a handful.

35:36.792 --> 35:39.500
I've somehow fallen
into the role of big sister.

35:39.583 --> 35:40.667
Check.

35:40.750 --> 35:43.500
You know, older, wiser, more beautiful.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.583
Checkmate.

35:46.125 --> 35:47.875
[Rosaline]
At the very least, more worldly.

35:52.250 --> 35:55.333
They definitely didn't teach that
in finishing school.

35:56.333 --> 35:59.250
[scoffs] Wait till you get to page 74.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.292
[gasps]

36:04.375 --> 36:05.583
Be sure that he gets this.

36:05.667 --> 36:06.667
But enough about her.

36:06.750 --> 36:11.083
I miss you and your warm embrace,
sweet Romeo.

36:11.167 --> 36:13.208
Yours, Rosaline.

36:14.583 --> 36:15.958
Dearest Romeo.

36:16.042 --> 36:19.625
You must be really busy,
because I still haven't heard from you.

36:19.708 --> 36:21.292
[laughs]

36:21.375 --> 36:24.333
I'm enclosing a map I made
of the Apennine mountains.

36:24.417 --> 36:28.708
I marked a trail to the perfect spot
for our remote mountaintop cabin.

36:28.792 --> 36:30.167
Write me back.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.833
I'm so lost without you.

36:32.917 --> 36:34.208
[sighs] Rosaline.

36:34.708 --> 36:36.208
-[water rushing]
-Where is that?

36:37.958 --> 36:40.208
It's the island of Cyprus
and Famagusta Bay.

36:42.083 --> 36:43.708
That's really beautiful.

36:45.917 --> 36:47.792
I'm sure you hear that all the time,
though.

36:49.667 --> 36:53.292
Uh, no, actually. I don't.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.500
Well, it's true.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.792
[Rosaline] Romeo, are you alive?

37:03.875 --> 37:05.542
Have you run out of quill ink?

37:06.250 --> 37:07.792
Why do you not return my letters?

37:08.458 --> 37:09.458
Steve!

37:11.125 --> 37:12.458
[bird caws]

37:13.042 --> 37:14.167
[sighs]

37:17.542 --> 37:22.917
The knight goes here,
and the pawn moves up one space.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.500
And that is a Ponziani opening.

37:25.542 --> 37:29.042
[sighs] You're awesome.

37:29.125 --> 37:30.625
[both chuckle]

37:30.708 --> 37:32.292
-[laughs]
-[handler] Whoa! Whoa!

37:32.833 --> 37:34.833
-Whoa.
-[handler] Whoa, whoa!

37:34.917 --> 37:36.792
[Juliet] Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

37:36.875 --> 37:39.917
-[horse whinnies]
-[shushes]

37:40.667 --> 37:42.750
-[Juliet] You're fine. You're fine.
-[horse blusters]

37:43.917 --> 37:46.750
You're so handsome. Yes.

37:46.833 --> 37:48.042
You are so good.

37:48.708 --> 37:50.375
He's just a little spooked.

37:51.083 --> 37:54.625
[humming]

38:00.417 --> 38:01.917
-[knocks on door]
-[humming stops]

38:13.375 --> 38:14.583
Rosaline.

38:14.667 --> 38:15.667
-Hey.
-Hi.

38:15.750 --> 38:18.292
Um, okay.

38:19.750 --> 38:23.583
I… [sighs] …have to tell you something.

38:23.667 --> 38:24.875
Okay.

38:28.625 --> 38:31.125
Look, this-- [sighs]

38:31.208 --> 38:36.750
This really isn't easy to admit,
but I, um--

38:40.167 --> 38:41.083
What are those?

38:44.917 --> 38:45.917
Um…

38:48.750 --> 38:50.167
He keeps writing me letters.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.333
He's been writing you letters?

38:59.833 --> 39:03.542
Uh, I mean,
I-I-I just thought you were done with him.

39:03.625 --> 39:06.458
I am. I was. No.

39:06.542 --> 39:10.000
No, I am. Um, but--
Uh, well, it's just, I feel-- [sighs]

39:10.083 --> 39:11.083
[Romeo] Juliet!

39:12.750 --> 39:14.125
Juliet!

39:17.292 --> 39:18.292
[inhales sharply] Um.

39:22.083 --> 39:23.083
[Romeo] Juliet!

39:23.583 --> 39:24.750
He keeps showing up.

39:24.833 --> 39:28.000
I won't go away until you talk to me,
sweet Juliet.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.583
Please, Rosaline. You gotta help me.

39:33.625 --> 39:34.792
Help you do what?

39:37.625 --> 39:39.958
[Juliet panting]

39:40.042 --> 39:42.875
Stand back, Romeo. Don't come any closer.

39:45.125 --> 39:47.417
Doth mine eyes deceive me?

39:47.500 --> 39:51.000
All the heavens shine in your direction.

39:51.083 --> 39:52.167
Stop him talking.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.625
-To gaze upon you--
-Stop talking.

39:53.708 --> 39:56.542
[sighs] I will not, Juliet.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.375
I will not and cannot,

39:58.458 --> 40:01.542
lest you tell me
what I have done to displease you.

40:01.625 --> 40:03.667
Fine. I'll tell you.

40:03.750 --> 40:05.333
-You're a phony.
-You're a pony.

40:05.417 --> 40:07.958
-A what?
-[whispers] Phony. He's a phony.

40:08.042 --> 40:09.708
Uh, a phony, I said.

40:09.792 --> 40:11.583
You're a liar and a scoundrel.

40:11.667 --> 40:13.667
[Romeo] Juliet,
you know I'm none of those things.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.750
So I was the first you compared
to the moon and the stars?

40:15.833 --> 40:18.958
Was I the first you compared
to the moon and the stars?

40:19.792 --> 40:21.542
[sighs] All right.

40:23.375 --> 40:26.667
Well, I will be honest with you.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.958
I-- I have said those words to another.

40:31.208 --> 40:33.375
But I never meant them until I met you.

40:33.875 --> 40:35.542
Oh, please!

40:37.500 --> 40:39.000
[Romeo] Is someone there with you?

40:39.542 --> 40:40.542
No.

40:41.250 --> 40:44.000
Juliet, we belong together.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.792
You need to go, Romeo.

40:48.750 --> 40:49.958
That truly what you want?

40:53.125 --> 40:54.208
You need to go, Romeo.

40:59.792 --> 41:00.792
Then I will go.

41:05.292 --> 41:06.292
Gone for good.

41:15.708 --> 41:16.708
[sobs]

41:44.250 --> 41:45.250
You did well.

41:47.542 --> 41:49.667
So, why do I feel so terrible?

41:50.167 --> 41:51.708
[breathes shakily]

41:54.333 --> 41:55.667
Thank you, Cousin.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.208
I'd be lost without you.

42:02.083 --> 42:05.083
Wait. Wasn't there something
you wanted to tell me?

42:06.208 --> 42:08.375
Oh. No, it's not important.

42:09.125 --> 42:10.125
[chuckles]

42:10.208 --> 42:11.333
-Ow! Oh!
-[grunts]

42:12.167 --> 42:13.583
-Why does this keep happening?
-Sorry.

42:13.667 --> 42:15.917
-Okay. Well, you just need to--
-If I just-- [grunts]

42:16.000 --> 42:18.792
-No. Just-- Mmm.
-[grunts, gasps] Oh!

42:18.875 --> 42:19.958
[chuckles]

42:22.833 --> 42:27.458
"Romeo and… Rosaline"?

42:33.667 --> 42:34.667
[gasps]

42:35.625 --> 42:36.750
Juliet.

42:36.833 --> 42:37.708
Don't speak.

42:42.333 --> 42:44.500
Juliet. It-- It's not what it--

42:44.583 --> 42:45.875
I listened to you.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.458
I trusted you,

42:49.542 --> 42:51.208
and all you did was lie.

42:51.292 --> 42:53.083
Juliet, I didn't lie.

42:53.167 --> 42:56.417
I just told you most of the truth

42:56.500 --> 43:00.542
instead of, well, you know, all of it.

43:01.625 --> 43:03.250
I thought you were my friend.

43:03.333 --> 43:05.583
I am your friend. I am.

43:05.667 --> 43:10.625
All this time, turns out you just wanted
to steal my boyfriend away.

43:10.708 --> 43:13.542
[scoffs] I was not trying
to steal your boyfriend away.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.125
I was just trying to steal him back.

43:15.792 --> 43:17.542
-Oh.
-There's a difference.

43:22.125 --> 43:23.167
I see how it is.

43:26.167 --> 43:27.167
Sure.

43:28.417 --> 43:32.125
I mean, it all makes perfect sense,
actually.

43:32.750 --> 43:33.875
I'm younger than you.

43:34.917 --> 43:37.000
I'm… richer than you.

43:38.250 --> 43:39.625
I'm not afraid of fish.

43:40.708 --> 43:43.417
I don't have huge man feet.

43:45.250 --> 43:47.500
You needed me
out of the picture. [chuckles]

43:47.583 --> 43:49.000
Of course you did.

43:50.000 --> 43:55.083
After all, what chance does someone like
you have when someone like me is around?

43:56.250 --> 43:57.250
[scoffs]

43:58.167 --> 44:03.250
Well, Cousin,
it appears your little gambit has failed.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.125
-Fine.
-Good.

44:08.208 --> 44:09.250
Great.

44:10.208 --> 44:13.083
Let me know next time
he shows up on your balcony.

44:13.167 --> 44:15.500
[laughs] Let me know
when your wisdom teeth come in.

44:16.625 --> 44:18.125
-What?
-You heard me!

44:18.208 --> 44:19.583
The point is, he's not coming.

44:19.667 --> 44:21.292
Guess we'll see about that, won't we?

44:22.750 --> 44:24.625
She's right. He's not coming.

44:24.708 --> 44:28.250
-Mmm. Oh.
-What's the use? It's hopeless.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.625
Rosaline, what is this?

44:30.625 --> 44:32.500
You need to focus and pull it together.

44:33.875 --> 44:34.875
Come here.

44:36.167 --> 44:38.667
I don't have a ton of time
for your drama right now, okay?

44:39.833 --> 44:44.250
Your father is not the only lord in town
who has a child he disapproves of.

44:44.333 --> 44:45.417
Mm-hmm.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.500
I'm sorry.

44:46.583 --> 44:48.875
If only I could just get him off the scent

44:48.958 --> 44:50.625
just for a little while.

44:51.708 --> 44:56.208
[gasps] Oh, this is cute. Mmm.

44:56.292 --> 44:57.958
-[laughing]
-[laughs]

44:58.042 --> 45:00.167
That's it! You marry her.

45:00.833 --> 45:02.625
-Who?
-Juliet.

45:02.708 --> 45:05.458
What? Have we met before? I'm-- I'm Paris.

45:06.292 --> 45:07.250
[scoffs]

45:08.667 --> 45:11.875
You need a decoy. She needs an obstacle.

45:11.958 --> 45:14.542
I need her out of the picture.

45:15.625 --> 45:16.667
It's perfect.

45:17.250 --> 45:21.292
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's not perfect for me.
I don't wanna marry a woman.

45:21.375 --> 45:24.500
Yeah, I know, but that's the best part.

45:25.083 --> 45:29.125
You won't have to marry her for another,
like, two or three years.

45:29.208 --> 45:32.708
And by that time,
you could be far away from here.

45:33.458 --> 45:34.833
You could be wherever you want.

45:36.875 --> 45:37.875
Mmm.

45:38.417 --> 45:43.000
And do you promise
to care for her and protect her?

45:43.083 --> 45:44.083
Mm-hmm.

45:44.792 --> 45:49.917
And do you promise to guide her morally
and keep her on a righteous path?

45:50.625 --> 45:51.833
Oh, for sure.

45:51.917 --> 45:54.375
And, when the time is right,

45:54.458 --> 46:00.708
to bring a whole host of
strapping young men into your household?

46:00.792 --> 46:01.792
Wait. What?

46:02.417 --> 46:03.417
Sons, Paris.

46:03.500 --> 46:05.167
Ya-- [clears throat]

46:05.250 --> 46:08.625
[in deep voice]
Yes, absolutely. Sons. Mm-hmm.

46:08.708 --> 46:13.083
Then it fills me with the greatest of joy
to accept your request.

46:13.167 --> 46:18.000
[laughs] In two years' time,
when the girl is of marrying age,

46:18.083 --> 46:23.417
we will have the most glorious celebration
to unite our families.

46:23.500 --> 46:27.250
Two years, three years,
I mean, there's-- there's really no rush.

46:27.333 --> 46:29.417
And tonight, we'll feast.

46:29.500 --> 46:32.583
Go. Tell all of West Verona,

46:32.667 --> 46:37.708
and I will go tell the lucky girl
the good news. [squeals]

46:37.792 --> 46:40.875
-She'll be so excited! [laughs]
-[chuckling]

46:41.417 --> 46:42.458
[whimpers]

46:42.542 --> 46:44.458
[Juliet] You can't do this to me!

46:44.542 --> 46:46.583
[Lord Capulet]
Of course I can! I'm your father!

46:46.667 --> 46:47.708
-[Juliet] No!
-Juliet,

46:47.792 --> 46:53.292
every respectable family in Verona is
downstairs, celebrating your engagement,

46:53.375 --> 46:55.542
while you're up here embarrassing me!

46:55.625 --> 46:56.958
[door rattles, opens]

46:58.000 --> 47:01.583
[pants] You know I'm not just
your daughter, right?

47:01.667 --> 47:05.542
I have opinions, ideas,
passions of my own!

47:06.042 --> 47:07.833
How dare you speak to us like that!

47:08.500 --> 47:10.542
You have ruined my life!

47:10.625 --> 47:12.083
-[Lady Capulet shouts]
-Juliet!

47:13.792 --> 47:15.500
I thought you'd be pleased.

47:15.583 --> 47:20.292
[stammers] Okay, he's Rosaline's friend.
Pretty big deal, he's a count.

47:21.333 --> 47:22.625
Rosaline's friend?

47:22.708 --> 47:25.250
Whole great life for your future. Please.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.250
Oh! [grunts]

47:29.333 --> 47:30.208
[sighs]

47:30.875 --> 47:33.292
I'm so sorry, dear.
I don't know what's gotten into her.

47:33.958 --> 47:36.125
Oh, I know exactly what's gotten into her.

47:37.583 --> 47:40.667
Rosaline, this is all your fault.

47:40.750 --> 47:43.792
Whatever wild ideas you've been
filling my daughter's head with--

47:43.875 --> 47:46.208
-[guest] Hello.
-Good to see you.

47:46.292 --> 47:48.542
I need you to unfill it at once.

47:49.125 --> 47:50.250
-Go up to her room,
-Mm-hmm.

47:50.333 --> 47:52.333
-get her down to her party, please.
-Mm-hmm.

47:52.417 --> 47:54.417
-Please.
-Yes. Certainly, Uncle.

47:55.792 --> 47:56.792
Go.

47:58.458 --> 47:59.667
-Paris.
-[slurps]

48:00.250 --> 48:01.208
[stammers]

48:03.208 --> 48:04.500
The hell was he wearing?

48:04.583 --> 48:06.542
[guests chattering, distantly]

48:17.542 --> 48:18.875
Juliet.

48:29.083 --> 48:30.083
Hello?

48:57.542 --> 48:59.333
"Hie you hence to the friar's cell,

48:59.417 --> 49:01.875
where tonight a true husband
shall make you a wife."

49:04.125 --> 49:05.125
Shit.

49:05.208 --> 49:07.375
[Rosaline] Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm in a rush.

49:07.458 --> 49:08.458
[guest] Oh!

49:10.042 --> 49:12.708
[Rosaline] Please move.
I've got to stop a wedding right now.

49:12.792 --> 49:14.083
[Adrian] There she is.

49:14.167 --> 49:15.958
Look, it's Dario.

49:16.042 --> 49:20.417
-I really don't have time for this. What?
-Rosaline, do not be rude, please.

49:21.583 --> 49:22.583
[chuckles]

49:24.500 --> 49:26.583
-Mwah. Mwah.
-There we go.

49:27.083 --> 49:28.417
Okay. Good night.

49:31.083 --> 49:32.500
She's coming around.

49:33.917 --> 49:35.375
-[bats screech]
-[wings flutter]

49:36.542 --> 49:37.667
[wolf howls]

49:40.208 --> 49:41.208
Hey!

49:45.625 --> 49:46.625
Where are you going?

49:48.792 --> 49:49.917
What do you care?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.125
I don't.

49:52.458 --> 49:53.917
Then what is it that you want?

49:56.250 --> 49:58.167
I want my knife back, please.

50:00.750 --> 50:02.083
[knife clatters]

50:02.167 --> 50:03.167
Worth a shot.

50:05.125 --> 50:07.417
[bird screeches, distantly]

50:08.500 --> 50:10.375
You aren't actually thinking
of going out there, are you?

50:10.458 --> 50:11.458
Yeah.

50:13.625 --> 50:15.042
Sure looks pretty dark.

50:15.833 --> 50:16.833
I can manage.

50:16.917 --> 50:19.000
[wolves howling]

50:19.083 --> 50:22.083
Look, I can--
I can walk with you if you'd like.

50:23.833 --> 50:25.958
I don't need an escort.

50:26.042 --> 50:29.167
Will just be taking this. See? This torch.

50:29.250 --> 50:31.833
To go in by myself.

50:31.917 --> 50:32.917
Mm-hmm.

50:34.625 --> 50:35.667
[sighs]

50:36.167 --> 50:37.292
[chuckles]

50:38.167 --> 50:39.250
[creature yowls]

50:39.333 --> 50:40.625
Christ! What was that?

50:41.125 --> 50:42.292
Oh, it's probably nothing.

50:42.958 --> 50:46.208
-[sighs, chuckles] Okay.
-Yeah, or a bear.

50:47.958 --> 50:49.125
Hmm. [smacks lips]

50:50.458 --> 50:54.625
Okay, well, maybe just to
the, uh, bridge after the forest.

50:54.708 --> 50:56.708
[clears throat] What?
I'm sorry. What was that?

50:56.792 --> 51:00.958
Could you please
escort me through the forest?

51:02.208 --> 51:03.458
I would love to.

51:03.542 --> 51:05.167
[chuckles] Right.

51:05.250 --> 51:08.250
-Just great.
-[wolf howls]

51:16.583 --> 51:18.667
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you where we're going.

51:19.208 --> 51:20.208
Oh, you're fine.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.708
What I can say is it's urgent.

51:24.625 --> 51:25.917
Extremely urgent.

51:26.958 --> 51:27.958
Okay.

51:29.333 --> 51:30.792
You're not even a little curious?

51:30.875 --> 51:32.708
-I don't get involved.
-[scoffs]

51:35.458 --> 51:36.500
It's this way.

51:38.875 --> 51:42.250
Well, if you must know,
I'm going to stop a wedding.

51:43.583 --> 51:47.667
My boyfriend is about to make
the biggest mistake of his life.

51:48.583 --> 51:49.958
Uh, hang on a second. Wait.

51:52.167 --> 51:54.375
It's your boyfriend's wedding?

51:55.583 --> 51:56.500
Yeah.

51:57.833 --> 51:59.000
Ouch.

52:00.208 --> 52:03.708
Yeah. They just met.
They barely know each other.

52:03.792 --> 52:07.083
They have literally nothing in common.
He can't possibly love her.

52:07.167 --> 52:08.792
[stammers] How do you know that?

52:08.875 --> 52:09.958
Were you listening just now?

52:10.042 --> 52:12.375
They just met.
They barely know each other.

52:12.458 --> 52:13.750
-So what?
-No, like--

52:13.833 --> 52:16.167
That's not how love works.
It isn't rational.

52:18.500 --> 52:19.917
I knew you wouldn't understand.

52:21.375 --> 52:23.500
So what's your plan when we get there?

52:25.125 --> 52:27.917
We have to have a conversation.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.250
He needs to know how I feel.

52:30.333 --> 52:32.917
Well, his wedding day seems
like the perfect time for that.

52:33.792 --> 52:36.833
We haven't had the chance
to talk about any of this,

52:36.917 --> 52:41.875
and I wanna show him
what life was like before he--

52:41.958 --> 52:42.958
Cheated on you.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.125
He did not cheat on me.

52:47.042 --> 52:48.167
Didn't he?

52:48.792 --> 52:50.125
I'm done talking to you now.

52:52.708 --> 52:54.458
[Dario] So is this a back way in or?

52:54.542 --> 52:56.917
Well, I'm not exactly
welcome in these parts.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.042
Oh. 'Cause you're the ex?

52:59.542 --> 53:00.958
No, 'cause I'm a Capulet.

53:03.125 --> 53:04.542
Wait. This is Montague land?

53:05.792 --> 53:08.375
-Yep.
-You never told me your ex was a Montague.

53:08.458 --> 53:09.500
Did I never mention that?

53:09.583 --> 53:10.458
-No.
-Hmm.

53:10.542 --> 53:12.208
If they find us, Rosaline,
they will kill us.

53:12.292 --> 53:16.167
-Well, you can go at any time.
-Look, this is no joke. It isn't safe.

53:16.250 --> 53:19.792
Relax. Romeo once told me that the guards
are off duty at this time of night.

53:19.875 --> 53:21.750
-The coast should be totally--
-Halt!

53:21.833 --> 53:23.042
Who goes there?

53:24.583 --> 53:25.958
[guard] Halt!

53:26.042 --> 53:27.417
Stop! Stop!

53:29.167 --> 53:30.375
They're over here!

53:30.458 --> 53:31.708
[guard] Halt! Stop!

53:32.333 --> 53:33.583
-[moans] Run!
-[grunts]

53:33.667 --> 53:34.500
[guard] Hurry up! Halt!

53:34.583 --> 53:35.625
Which way did we come in?

53:35.708 --> 53:36.708
-Uh, that way, I think!
-[guard] Stop!

53:36.792 --> 53:38.917
-You think?
-I wasn't in the military!

53:39.000 --> 53:39.958
[guard] Halt!

53:40.042 --> 53:42.833
-[panting]
-[guards shouting]

53:42.917 --> 53:45.750
-[guard] Hey! They went this way! Come on!
-[guard 2] Spread out!

53:45.833 --> 53:47.667
[Dario grunting] Come on!

53:47.750 --> 53:49.125
[Rosaline] Come on!

53:49.208 --> 53:50.500
[guards shouting]

53:53.083 --> 53:55.042
[whispers] Do you have a match?

53:59.417 --> 54:00.625
Are you sure this is safe?

54:03.667 --> 54:04.667
Trust me.

54:04.750 --> 54:06.042
[matchstick lights]

54:08.792 --> 54:11.125
[guards snoring]

54:12.750 --> 54:14.583
-[whispers] You were saying?
-[beds creaking]

54:15.917 --> 54:17.417
-[metal scrapes]
-[crash]

54:17.500 --> 54:19.208
[items clatter]

54:19.292 --> 54:20.625
-[guard] What was that?
-[guards groaning]

54:20.708 --> 54:22.208
-What? What?
-[guard 2] Wake up!

54:22.292 --> 54:24.250
-Take my knife.
-I already have it.

54:24.333 --> 54:25.833
[grunting]

54:25.917 --> 54:26.917
[Rosaline] Ho!

54:27.000 --> 54:28.583
[guard yells, grunts]

54:28.667 --> 54:30.375
[grunting and groaning]

54:34.000 --> 54:35.500
[laughs]

54:40.542 --> 54:41.708
[laughs]

54:43.375 --> 54:44.875
[exhales]

54:45.667 --> 54:46.792
[Dario groans]

54:47.333 --> 54:49.083
[grunting]

54:49.167 --> 54:50.292
Dario, look out!

54:55.500 --> 54:57.000
[grunting]

54:57.083 --> 54:58.417
Lucky throw.

54:59.208 --> 55:00.208
Lucky knife.

55:01.250 --> 55:02.208
[grunts]

55:05.333 --> 55:07.000
-[alarm bell ringing]
-[guards yelling]

55:07.083 --> 55:08.917
-[sighs]
-Let's go. Go. Go. Go.

55:09.417 --> 55:12.292
[guards] Come on! Hurry up!

55:12.375 --> 55:13.917
[guard] Through here.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.500
[guard] You take the north barracks,
we'll cover the south!

55:17.500 --> 55:19.542
I see them right there!
Right down that way!

55:19.625 --> 55:20.750
Move, move, move!

55:20.833 --> 55:22.042
[horse whinnies]

55:22.125 --> 55:23.250
[guard] This way!

55:25.292 --> 55:27.375
-[guard] Go, go, go, go!
-[guard 2] Hey!

55:27.458 --> 55:28.500
[water sloshes]

55:28.583 --> 55:29.958
-[door slams]
-[horse whinnies]

56:04.250 --> 56:06.542
[horses panting]

56:06.625 --> 56:07.708
[horse whinnies]

56:23.375 --> 56:24.375
[clears throat]

56:26.292 --> 56:27.750
Hey, let me ask you something.

56:29.500 --> 56:31.333
What is it you like about this Montague?

56:33.500 --> 56:36.208
Uh, lots of stuff.

56:37.333 --> 56:38.750
In particular.

56:40.083 --> 56:42.583
Well, we're in love.

56:44.042 --> 56:45.458
Then what do you love about him?

56:47.167 --> 56:48.542
[sighs] It's just--

56:48.625 --> 56:51.667
It's not something
that you can put into words, so…

56:54.500 --> 56:56.583
Love is patient.

56:57.208 --> 56:58.542
Love is kind.

56:58.625 --> 57:00.458
Love is an open door.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.750
Love is all you need.

57:04.083 --> 57:08.208
I mean, love is like knowing how to fly
or how to breathe.

57:09.792 --> 57:13.792
When you're apart from her,
you can feel it in your stomach.

57:14.750 --> 57:15.875
You can taste it.

57:16.917 --> 57:19.208
And when you're together, it's like…

57:21.167 --> 57:23.208
it's impossible to believe
for one single minute

57:23.292 --> 57:25.250
that anyone anywhere
has ever had so much fun

57:25.333 --> 57:26.542
in the whole entire world.

57:29.542 --> 57:30.958
That's what love is like,

57:32.042 --> 57:33.583
put into words.

57:34.292 --> 57:36.000
It's not that hard.

57:37.125 --> 57:38.125
[grunts]

57:50.208 --> 57:51.208
[sighs]

57:54.583 --> 57:55.583
[Dario, clears throat]

58:02.958 --> 58:04.250
I'm…

58:05.917 --> 58:08.292
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess.

58:09.917 --> 58:10.917
Wasn't all bad.

58:12.292 --> 58:13.583
-And…
-[clears throat]

58:14.375 --> 58:18.208
I'm sorry that I might have…

58:19.667 --> 58:23.333
maybe misjudged you a little.

58:23.417 --> 58:24.625
Your hand.

58:26.167 --> 58:28.708
Oh. [scoffs] It's fine.
It's just a little, um--

58:28.792 --> 58:29.792
[Dario] No.

58:29.875 --> 58:32.958
I could probably get that later.

58:39.292 --> 58:40.292
Is that okay?

58:43.750 --> 58:44.750
Yeah.

58:55.917 --> 58:56.833
Thank you.

58:58.417 --> 58:59.417
You're welcome.

59:09.958 --> 59:11.042
[Rosaline sighs]

59:14.333 --> 59:15.875
-[crows caw, wings flutter]
-[gasps]

59:16.750 --> 59:17.750
[chuckles]

59:19.333 --> 59:20.625
[clears throat]

59:22.750 --> 59:23.750
I should go.

59:25.792 --> 59:28.083
Yeah, same.

59:28.167 --> 59:30.625
No, uh, supposed to rejoin the fleet today

59:30.708 --> 59:32.250
and I haven't even started to pack.

59:33.167 --> 59:34.375
You're really going back?

59:34.875 --> 59:35.875
Yeah.

59:36.458 --> 59:37.458
Why?

59:40.250 --> 59:42.833
I guess I didn't find
a good enough reason to stay.

59:45.292 --> 59:47.125
Good luck, Rosaline.

59:48.500 --> 59:52.708
It was interesting getting to know you.

59:56.208 --> 59:57.208
You too, Dario.

1:00:08.500 --> 1:00:09.833
[horse nickers]

1:00:13.958 --> 1:00:17.625
-[horses depart]
-[clinking]

1:00:30.708 --> 1:00:31.708
[sighs]

1:00:32.792 --> 1:00:34.000
[door locks]

1:00:53.083 --> 1:00:54.083
Late night?

1:00:54.167 --> 1:00:55.667
-[door rattles]
-Oh! Oh, my God.

1:00:55.750 --> 1:00:57.667
[pants]

1:00:57.750 --> 1:00:59.250
[sighs] You scared me.

1:00:59.333 --> 1:01:00.583
Good, that makes two of us.

1:01:00.667 --> 1:01:02.625
[birds twittering]

1:01:02.708 --> 1:01:03.625
[sighs]

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.167
What on earth have you been
doing until six in the morning?

1:01:11.417 --> 1:01:12.542
It's complicated.

1:01:19.625 --> 1:01:21.500
Nurse, can I ask you something?

1:01:25.542 --> 1:01:26.750
Have you ever been in love?

1:01:28.333 --> 1:01:31.042
I was, once.

1:01:34.125 --> 1:01:35.333
And what did it feel like?

1:01:39.917 --> 1:01:41.542
It's a bit like having vertigo.

1:01:43.958 --> 1:01:45.708
Quite a lot like being drunk.

1:01:46.833 --> 1:01:49.333
But when it's real, you won't question it.

1:01:54.375 --> 1:01:56.708
[footsteps departing]

1:02:40.375 --> 1:02:41.708
[taps inkwell]

1:03:23.833 --> 1:03:25.000
[coughs, grunts]

1:03:27.292 --> 1:03:28.375
[banging on door]

1:03:30.125 --> 1:03:31.500
[door unlocks]

1:03:31.583 --> 1:03:33.625
[door creaks]

1:03:33.708 --> 1:03:35.292
Yeah, what up, man?

1:03:35.375 --> 1:03:36.875
Uh, special delivery.

1:03:37.917 --> 1:03:40.083
[chuckles] Thanks, Chief.

1:03:40.167 --> 1:03:44.500
Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, also, um,
I got an envelope.

1:03:45.417 --> 1:03:49.583
A miss H-H-Huliet. J-- Hu-- Juliet.

1:03:49.667 --> 1:03:51.083
-Ju--
-I'll see that she gets it.

1:03:51.792 --> 1:03:54.333
All right, man. All right, right on.

1:04:03.125 --> 1:04:04.583
[horse blusters]

1:04:11.542 --> 1:04:12.542
Oh.

1:04:14.333 --> 1:04:16.500
Steve, I just saw you.

1:04:20.250 --> 1:04:21.250
You back already?

1:04:21.333 --> 1:04:23.458
Uh, yes, Miss Rosaline.

1:04:24.417 --> 1:04:29.167
I was just, uh, you know.

1:04:29.250 --> 1:04:31.458
-[Steve chuckles]
-[woman chuckles]

1:04:31.542 --> 1:04:32.833
Did she seem pleased?

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.625
Yeah. Pleased?

1:04:35.708 --> 1:04:36.625
Mmm.

1:04:36.708 --> 1:04:37.792
-[both chuckle]
-Juliet!

1:04:38.458 --> 1:04:40.125
-Oh, oh.
-When you gave her the letter.

1:04:40.208 --> 1:04:41.250
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1:04:41.333 --> 1:04:44.917
Um, I-I gave it to the big dude instead.

1:04:45.917 --> 1:04:47.625
Big dude?

1:04:47.708 --> 1:04:49.708
W-W-What dude? W-Which dude?

1:04:50.708 --> 1:04:52.167
Uh, Master Tybalt.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:54.958
Shit.

1:04:55.042 --> 1:04:56.708
-[Paris] Ros, Ros!
-[running footsteps]

1:04:56.792 --> 1:04:57.875
-[bell tolls]
-What?

1:04:57.958 --> 1:04:59.083
[panting] Oh, hey.

1:04:59.167 --> 1:05:00.625
It's Romeo and Tybalt.

1:05:00.708 --> 1:05:01.792
-[bell tolls]
-Oh.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:06.667
[Lord Capulet] You cream-faced loon!

1:05:06.750 --> 1:05:08.500
-What have you to say for yourself?
-[crowd clamors]

1:05:08.583 --> 1:05:11.750
-[Montague] Thou art as fat as butter.
-[Capulet] Venomous toad!

1:05:11.833 --> 1:05:13.125
-[groans]
-[Rosaline] Mercutio.

1:05:13.208 --> 1:05:15.333
-[Capulet] How dare you speak like that!
-[Montague] I'll speak any way I wish!

1:05:15.417 --> 1:05:16.542
[Juliet] Father, please!

1:05:16.625 --> 1:05:18.583
[Lord Capulet] Miscreants!
Look what you've done.

1:05:18.667 --> 1:05:19.833
[onlooker cries]

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:22.917
[Capulet] Tybalt is dead.
I should kill all of you!

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:24.458
[scoffs] I'd like to see you try.

1:05:24.542 --> 1:05:26.042
-Stop this!
-You great rooting hog!

1:05:26.125 --> 1:05:28.000
-[sighs]
-Your son is a murderer.

1:05:28.083 --> 1:05:31.500
It was self-defense.
Fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.

1:05:31.583 --> 1:05:32.667
You liar!

1:05:32.750 --> 1:05:34.250
He's not lying.

1:05:34.333 --> 1:05:39.500
He's honest and kind, and a good person.

1:05:39.583 --> 1:05:42.583
His heart knows no hate or anger.

1:05:42.667 --> 1:05:44.417
If he says that he was challenged,

1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:46.458
then I promise you
that he's telling the truth.

1:05:46.542 --> 1:05:49.625
I'm sorry. How do you know him?

1:05:52.083 --> 1:05:53.792
[inhales sharply, sighs]

1:05:57.125 --> 1:05:58.500
-He's my husband.
-[crowd gasps]

1:05:58.583 --> 1:05:59.625
-Oh, my God.
-We're in love.

1:05:59.708 --> 1:06:01.250
[Lady Capulet] I can't even watch them.

1:06:01.333 --> 1:06:03.333
-Ah.
-Oh, boy.

1:06:03.417 --> 1:06:05.750
You will never see him again.

1:06:05.833 --> 1:06:08.917
And you will be banished.
Never to set foot in Verona again.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:09.833
No!

1:06:09.917 --> 1:06:13.708
You will have this farce annulled
and marry Count Paris in the morrow.

1:06:13.792 --> 1:06:14.792
[Juliet] Father, no!

1:06:14.875 --> 1:06:17.000
-Uh, I'm sorry, what?
-You can't do this!

1:06:17.083 --> 1:06:19.583
Y-Yeah. Tomorrow doesn't
really work for me either. So…

1:06:19.667 --> 1:06:20.500
[Capulet] Guards!

1:06:21.375 --> 1:06:22.750
-No!
-Detain him!

1:06:22.833 --> 1:06:24.292
-He's getting away!
-[bystander screams]

1:06:24.375 --> 1:06:25.542
Run, my heart!

1:06:25.625 --> 1:06:28.250
I won't let them keep us apart, my love!

1:06:29.250 --> 1:06:31.750
You know what this means, Lord Montague?

1:06:31.833 --> 1:06:33.667
Yes, I do, Lord Capulet.

1:06:34.583 --> 1:06:36.042
It means war!

1:06:36.125 --> 1:06:37.167
You bald-headed peasant!

1:06:37.250 --> 1:06:38.917
I'll see you soon, calf guts!

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.333
-Give--
-Will you? [grunts]

1:06:40.417 --> 1:06:41.333
[Lady Capulet] Stop.

1:06:41.417 --> 1:06:42.917
[Lord Capulet] Summon my army for battle!

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.167
Juliet, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll fix this. I'll find a way.

1:06:47.250 --> 1:06:49.042
Haven't you done enough already?

1:07:00.542 --> 1:07:05.667
[Rosaline panting]
Oh, thank God you're still here.

1:07:07.542 --> 1:07:08.875
Uh, okay.

1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:12.917
I don't know if you heard about
the whole Romeo and Juliet thing?

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.833
-But things got a little out of hand.
-Yeah.

1:07:14.917 --> 1:07:15.917
I heard.

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:20.083
But not to worry. I've come up
with a plan to fix everything.

1:07:20.167 --> 1:07:21.875
It's just gonna take you and I to--

1:07:21.958 --> 1:07:25.792
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait.
You want my help with this?

1:07:25.875 --> 1:07:27.667
I told you. I don't get involved.

1:07:27.750 --> 1:07:29.042
Fine, except--

1:07:29.125 --> 1:07:32.417
Besides, the last time I helped you,
we were almost killed.

1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:34.042
Okay, but that's--

1:07:34.125 --> 1:07:35.375
There is no "but," Rosaline.

1:07:35.458 --> 1:07:38.750
Okay. Could you just at least
put on a shirt or something?

1:07:40.167 --> 1:07:41.042
[huffs]

1:07:43.458 --> 1:07:44.750
-[boat creaking]
-[footsteps]

1:07:49.542 --> 1:07:50.583
Why?

1:07:50.667 --> 1:07:55.542
Because I'm trying to have
a conversation here, and it's--

1:07:57.250 --> 1:07:58.500
it's distracting.

1:08:01.750 --> 1:08:02.750
[sighs]

1:08:06.250 --> 1:08:07.792
So I've made some mistakes.

1:08:09.375 --> 1:08:11.042
Okay, a lot of mistakes.

1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:15.292
I was wrong about Romeo.
I was wrong about Juliet.

1:08:15.375 --> 1:08:18.750
I-I was even wrong about me
in a lot of ways.

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:22.000
But I know that
I'm not wrong about this, Dario.

1:08:22.083 --> 1:08:23.750
We need to make this right.

1:08:23.833 --> 1:08:24.958
There's that "we" again.

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:28.500
Yes, we.

1:08:28.583 --> 1:08:31.042
'Cause another thing
I was wrong about, is you.

1:08:34.875 --> 1:08:36.625
You're completely full of shit.

1:08:37.583 --> 1:08:38.542
Oh, yeah?

1:08:38.625 --> 1:08:42.875
The whole, "Oh, mmm, I don't care
about other people. I just--

1:08:42.958 --> 1:08:45.208
I don't wanna get involved" nonsense.

1:08:45.792 --> 1:08:47.500
It's a big load of crap, Dario.

1:08:47.583 --> 1:08:48.542
[chuckles]

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:50.125
You care about people.

1:08:51.750 --> 1:08:53.042
You're a good person.

1:08:55.833 --> 1:08:58.000
This is 'cause I have a boat, isn't it?

1:08:58.583 --> 1:09:00.000
No, that's--

1:09:00.083 --> 1:09:01.208
They're in trouble.

1:09:02.167 --> 1:09:05.667
They're in trouble, and I'm responsible.

1:09:06.542 --> 1:09:08.458
I need to fix this.

1:09:10.625 --> 1:09:11.917
Will you please help me?

1:09:16.542 --> 1:09:18.417
First sign of danger and I'm out of there.

1:09:19.208 --> 1:09:20.542
-Fine.
-Seriously.

1:09:20.625 --> 1:09:22.292
I'm not getting killed over this.

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:23.875
Yeah, I-I-I just said fine.

1:09:33.583 --> 1:09:34.583
Okay.

1:09:36.833 --> 1:09:38.792
-[sighs]
-Let's go save true love.

1:09:38.875 --> 1:09:42.167
Great. Um… [stammers]

1:09:42.250 --> 1:09:43.833
Is it cool if we borrow the boat?

1:09:46.417 --> 1:09:47.750
[stammers]

1:09:52.167 --> 1:09:53.167
[Juliet sighs]

1:09:57.042 --> 1:09:59.333
-[door opens]
-[light grunt]

1:09:59.917 --> 1:10:01.542
Shh. Now be quiet.

1:10:01.625 --> 1:10:02.542
[Dario] Ow.

1:10:02.625 --> 1:10:03.917
Rosaline!

1:10:05.917 --> 1:10:07.208
Hey.

1:10:07.292 --> 1:10:08.750
What are you doing here?

1:10:08.833 --> 1:10:11.292
I have come to help you.

1:10:12.167 --> 1:10:14.125
I don't want your help, Rosaline.

1:10:14.208 --> 1:10:15.250
I know that.

1:10:15.333 --> 1:10:18.083
And again,
I'm really, really, really sorry.

1:10:18.167 --> 1:10:22.458
But we've got a boat. [chuckles]

1:10:22.542 --> 1:10:25.667
Well, actually-- actually, Dario--
Dario has a boat.

1:10:25.750 --> 1:10:26.667
[Dario] Hello.

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:28.917
We'll get Romeo,
smuggle you both to the docks,

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.458
and then, under the cover of darkness,

1:10:30.542 --> 1:10:33.417
you'll sail to safety before anyone
realizes that you're gone.

1:10:35.375 --> 1:10:39.500
That's, um, very kind of you, Cousin.

1:10:40.708 --> 1:10:41.917
But I already have a plan.

1:10:43.292 --> 1:10:44.292
You do?

1:10:44.792 --> 1:10:46.250
[cage rattles]

1:10:46.333 --> 1:10:49.250
Okay, that's-- that's great.

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:51.458
Uh, w-what is it?

1:10:51.542 --> 1:10:53.458
I'm going to fake my own death.

1:10:54.583 --> 1:10:55.583
Sorry, what?

1:10:55.667 --> 1:10:56.500
It's simple.

1:10:56.583 --> 1:11:00.917
There's this potion that causes
total body paralysis for hours at a time.

1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.500
I'll drink it, they'll find me,
it'll look like I'm dead,

1:11:03.583 --> 1:11:05.125
then they'll prepare me for burial.

1:11:05.917 --> 1:11:07.500
Then, once they leave, I'll wake up.

1:11:08.292 --> 1:11:09.667
Romeo will then come out of hiding.

1:11:09.750 --> 1:11:13.167
He's at the Montague chapel
with Benvolio right now.

1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.833
Then he'll find me in the church,
carry me off into the sunset,

1:11:16.917 --> 1:11:18.917
and we'll live happily ever after.

1:11:19.625 --> 1:11:20.625
It's foolproof.

1:11:21.583 --> 1:11:23.625
Mmm, okay. Juliet,

1:11:24.375 --> 1:11:28.917
that is quite possibly the dumbest fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:29.958
Are you kidding me?

1:11:30.042 --> 1:11:32.750
There's, like, 50 different ways that
that could go wrong.

1:11:32.833 --> 1:11:34.917
I mean,
what if the potion has side effects?

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:39.292
What if they actually bury you?
Have you thought of that?

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:41.583
What if Romeo thinks you're really dead?

1:11:42.458 --> 1:11:45.333
I've-- I've sent Steve the Courier
to tell him.

1:11:45.417 --> 1:11:47.583
Steve the Courier is an idiot!

1:11:47.667 --> 1:11:48.792
You've gotta trust me.

1:11:48.875 --> 1:11:51.208
-My plan is better. Let's go.
-[groans]

1:11:51.708 --> 1:11:52.708
Juliet?

1:11:52.792 --> 1:11:54.292
-[Juliet groans]
-What did-- What--

1:12:00.167 --> 1:12:01.333
Did you drink it already?

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:03.750
-[quick footsteps]
-[Rosaline grunts]

1:12:03.833 --> 1:12:06.375
Okay. [grunts] All right.

1:12:06.458 --> 1:12:09.958
When you wake up, you'll be right
next to Romeo, okay? I promise.

1:12:10.042 --> 1:12:11.500
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1:12:11.583 --> 1:12:13.542
Okay, wow. [chuckles]

1:12:13.625 --> 1:12:16.417
Dario, you ready? [pants]

1:12:16.500 --> 1:12:17.833
[whispers] Yeah, I am.

1:12:17.917 --> 1:12:18.917
[Rosaline] You sure?

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.375
Yes, just toss her to me.

1:12:23.542 --> 1:12:25.250
Okay. On three.

1:12:26.458 --> 1:12:29.500
One… [panting]

1:12:31.375 --> 1:12:32.500
Nope. Oh--

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.083
[grunts] One. [sighs]

1:12:36.167 --> 1:12:37.583
-[Lord Capulet] Juliet?
-[knocking]

1:12:37.667 --> 1:12:38.583
Shit.

1:12:39.417 --> 1:12:40.417
[Lord Capulet] Juliet!

1:12:40.500 --> 1:12:42.458
[grunting] Wake up, Juliet!

1:12:42.542 --> 1:12:44.083
Dario, save yourself.

1:12:44.167 --> 1:12:45.083
[banging on door]

1:12:45.167 --> 1:12:46.958
[Lord Capulet] Open this door at once!

1:12:47.417 --> 1:12:49.167
[Rosaline] That sneaky son of a bitch!

1:12:49.250 --> 1:12:50.292
Juliet!

1:12:52.292 --> 1:12:53.792
Okay, it's not what it looks like.

1:12:54.750 --> 1:12:56.208
[door creaks]

1:12:56.292 --> 1:12:57.417
If you just-- [grunts]

1:12:57.958 --> 1:12:59.167
If you just let me explain.

1:12:59.250 --> 1:13:03.208
I think we could really just have
a nice talk and talk about it.

1:13:03.292 --> 1:13:05.042
And I can explain everything. Please.

1:13:05.917 --> 1:13:06.875
-[sighs]
-[door locks]

1:13:06.958 --> 1:13:07.917
[bell chiming]

1:13:09.250 --> 1:13:10.250
Okay.

1:13:13.458 --> 1:13:15.708
[door unlocks, opens]

1:13:18.542 --> 1:13:19.417
Oh, thank God.

1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:21.750
Okay, you have got to help me, Father.

1:13:21.833 --> 1:13:24.167
They found Juliet in your arms.

1:13:24.250 --> 1:13:25.625
Yeah, I know.

1:13:25.708 --> 1:13:27.583
And I-- I can explain that,

1:13:27.667 --> 1:13:30.042
but right now, I just need you
to help me get out of here.

1:13:30.125 --> 1:13:33.000
Rosaline, your cousin is dead.

1:13:33.083 --> 1:13:35.167
-Who knows she's dead?
-The whole town.

1:13:35.250 --> 1:13:37.583
[sighs] Okay, look.

1:13:38.583 --> 1:13:42.167
Things seem really bad right now.
I get it.

1:13:42.250 --> 1:13:46.875
But you know me, and you know
I would never ever hurt Juliet.

1:13:49.167 --> 1:13:53.250
Look, I know I'm not exactly
the daughter you wish I was

1:13:53.333 --> 1:13:59.167
but, just this once,
I need you to trust me, please.

1:14:02.833 --> 1:14:04.750
I honestly don't know what to think.

1:14:11.958 --> 1:14:15.083
But you will always be
the daughter I wish you were.

1:14:20.208 --> 1:14:22.667
Guards! A Montague. Over there!

1:14:22.750 --> 1:14:24.542
-Go! Go!
-[footsteps running]

1:14:24.625 --> 1:14:26.792
[guard] Halt. Don't let him get away!

1:14:28.125 --> 1:14:29.542
[panting]

1:14:34.667 --> 1:14:36.167
-My lord.
-[bell tolling]

1:14:36.750 --> 1:14:38.417
Juliet Capulet is dead.

1:14:38.500 --> 1:14:39.958
Suicide, apparently.

1:14:40.042 --> 1:14:41.708
They're burying her body in the church.

1:14:43.125 --> 1:14:45.542
Where Juliet lies,
Romeo shan't be far away.

1:14:46.667 --> 1:14:48.667
We must get to him
before the Capulets. Come!

1:15:02.875 --> 1:15:04.917
[water rushing]

1:15:10.333 --> 1:15:11.542
Okay.

1:15:12.792 --> 1:15:14.000
Uh…

1:15:15.667 --> 1:15:19.708
[sighs]
It's okay. It's okay. You got this.

1:15:20.417 --> 1:15:24.417
Just pretend they're something else.
You know, leaves with gaping mouths.

1:15:25.125 --> 1:15:26.458
[sighs]

1:15:28.083 --> 1:15:29.583
Okay, just get in.

1:15:29.667 --> 1:15:32.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm in. I'm in.

1:15:32.208 --> 1:15:35.333
[groans] Okay. [huffs] Yes.

1:15:35.417 --> 1:15:37.375
Oh, my God. What was that? What was that?

1:15:37.458 --> 1:15:39.000
[groans] What was that?

1:15:39.083 --> 1:15:42.625
[pants] Okay. [stammers] It's just a leaf.
It was just a leaf.

1:15:43.458 --> 1:15:44.750
Mmm, just a leaf.

1:15:44.833 --> 1:15:47.417
[grunts] I made it. I made it.

1:15:49.875 --> 1:15:50.958
This is not gonna work.

1:15:54.250 --> 1:15:56.292
My lady, your clothes.

1:15:56.375 --> 1:15:57.583
Where's-- Where's Romeo?

1:15:57.667 --> 1:15:58.667
[pants]

1:15:59.208 --> 1:16:01.750
-Um. [smacks lips] I, uh--
-[sighs]

1:16:03.750 --> 1:16:06.167
Focus. Did he get the message?

1:16:06.667 --> 1:16:08.417
-What message?
-From Juliet.

1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:11.000
[sighs] Oh, my God.

1:16:11.583 --> 1:16:13.042
Okay. Okay.

1:16:13.125 --> 1:16:14.792
-Can, uh--
-Mmm. Mm-hmm.

1:16:15.292 --> 1:16:16.417
Oh, dear God.

1:16:23.167 --> 1:16:30.125
[panting]

1:16:30.750 --> 1:16:31.708
[grunts]

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:36.000
Oh, no, no, no.

1:16:36.083 --> 1:16:39.083
[panting] Oh, my God.

1:16:39.167 --> 1:16:41.667
-Uh, Rosaline, no. You-- [grunts]
-You! You get out of my way!

1:16:41.750 --> 1:16:42.750
[huffs]

1:16:43.625 --> 1:16:45.167
Oh. Oh, my God.

1:16:45.667 --> 1:16:47.458
No, no, it's not real.

1:16:47.542 --> 1:16:49.458
Juliet's alive. She's al--

1:16:49.542 --> 1:16:51.625
Get a grip, Rosaline.

1:16:51.708 --> 1:16:53.208
I was trying to tell you.

1:16:53.292 --> 1:16:55.375
But you-- you ran away.

1:16:55.458 --> 1:16:56.750
As fast as I could.

1:16:56.833 --> 1:16:59.208
Oh, you ran to him.

1:16:59.292 --> 1:17:00.542
Someone had to.

1:17:00.625 --> 1:17:03.417
I mean, the kid was gonna off himself
when he heard the news.

1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:05.417
[church bell tolling]

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:08.417
[sighs] Uh, what now?

1:17:09.083 --> 1:17:13.083
He said you would know what to do
because you're a… genius?

1:17:16.500 --> 1:17:17.667
Hmm. [smacks lips]

1:17:17.750 --> 1:17:20.208
Okay, lay down as you were.

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:23.042
Close your eyes. Quickly.

1:17:24.875 --> 1:17:26.042
Now you're both dead.

1:17:26.667 --> 1:17:28.917
Star-crossed lovers
that couldn't live apart.

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:30.000
That's pretty good.

1:17:30.083 --> 1:17:31.708
Uh, you think that's gonna work?

1:17:32.333 --> 1:17:34.250
I mean, it might if she doesn't wake up.

1:17:34.333 --> 1:17:35.667
[door opens]

1:17:37.333 --> 1:17:38.542
-[clears throat]
-[sighs]

1:17:38.625 --> 1:17:40.333
[footsteps approaching]

1:17:40.417 --> 1:17:41.458
Oh!

1:17:41.542 --> 1:17:44.333
Heaven forsake me! [whimpers]

1:17:44.417 --> 1:17:46.875
Oh, no! Why?

1:17:46.958 --> 1:17:48.542
[whimpers]

1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:51.500
What is she doing here?

1:17:51.583 --> 1:17:54.208
-[Adrian] Rosaline?
-What are all of you doing here?

1:17:54.292 --> 1:17:56.625
[Lord Montague]
Where is my boy? Where is he?

1:17:57.208 --> 1:17:58.417
Lord Montague.

1:17:58.500 --> 1:17:59.375
[Lady Montague gasps]

1:17:59.458 --> 1:18:01.875
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're too late.

1:18:01.958 --> 1:18:02.958
No.

1:18:05.625 --> 1:18:08.500
Dear, foolish boy. [sighs]

1:18:08.583 --> 1:18:11.333
There were so many things
I never got to tell you.

1:18:11.833 --> 1:18:14.292
Come back to me!

1:18:14.375 --> 1:18:16.667
-Oh. All right, well--
-Foolish boy! [sighs]

1:18:16.750 --> 1:18:18.250
Come back to me!

1:18:18.333 --> 1:18:20.708
Uh, shaking him won't bring him back. So…

1:18:21.875 --> 1:18:22.875
[high-pitched groan]

1:18:24.250 --> 1:18:26.125
[imitates groan, clears throat]

1:18:27.250 --> 1:18:30.000
Sorry, wrong pipe.

1:18:30.667 --> 1:18:34.792
Capulet, your daughter
is responsible for the death of my son!

1:18:34.875 --> 1:18:36.583
You are such a liar!

1:18:37.083 --> 1:18:40.750
Truth be told, Montague,
you are the one to blame.

1:18:40.833 --> 1:18:43.167
[Lord Montague scoffs]
I should kill you now.

1:18:43.250 --> 1:18:45.833
For the love of God!

1:18:45.917 --> 1:18:48.333
Will you stop fighting?

1:18:48.417 --> 1:18:50.333
This is all your faults.

1:18:50.417 --> 1:18:51.917
-You.
-What?

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000
-And you.
-[scoffs]

1:18:53.583 --> 1:18:55.792
Every single one of you people.

1:18:55.875 --> 1:18:57.500
They'd still be alive if not for

1:18:57.583 --> 1:19:03.000
your baseless judgments and blind hatred
and petty squabbling.

1:19:03.083 --> 1:19:05.250
Adrian, control your daughter.

1:19:05.333 --> 1:19:07.042
Shut it, Mario. Let her speak.

1:19:07.125 --> 1:19:08.500
[huffs, sighs]

1:19:08.583 --> 1:19:09.792
He was a Montague.

1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:12.000
She was a Capulet.

1:19:12.708 --> 1:19:13.708
So what?

1:19:15.250 --> 1:19:18.708
That didn't stop them from
seeing the beauty in each other.

1:19:20.125 --> 1:19:22.667
That didn't stop them
from falling in love.

1:19:23.542 --> 1:19:25.042
You know what did stop them?

1:19:26.958 --> 1:19:28.167
You did.

1:19:29.917 --> 1:19:32.375
This-- This stupid war.

1:19:32.458 --> 1:19:34.500
This-- This-- This selfishness.

1:19:34.583 --> 1:19:37.250
Shame on you!

1:19:39.458 --> 1:19:41.625
And-- And-- And shame on your houses!

1:19:41.708 --> 1:19:42.708
[Dario] A little unfair.

1:19:44.292 --> 1:19:45.667
Mmm, she's right, you know?

1:19:45.750 --> 1:19:46.792
[chuckles]

1:19:47.292 --> 1:19:49.167
-Well, it is our fault.
-Mmm?

1:19:49.250 --> 1:19:51.417
-Theirs mostly.
-[Lady Montague] Ah, that's what I meant.

1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:55.000
The two of you
with your heads stuck right up your asses.

1:19:55.083 --> 1:19:57.667
-Oh, no.
-[all gasps, clamors]

1:19:57.750 --> 1:19:58.750
Mmm.

1:20:01.042 --> 1:20:03.500
Perhaps enough blood has been shed.

1:20:05.917 --> 1:20:08.083
Let's end this war, Capulet.

1:20:08.917 --> 1:20:12.000
If their deaths be the last,
they shall not have died in vain.

1:20:13.250 --> 1:20:15.500
So, let our families be close.

1:20:15.583 --> 1:20:18.583
United by the loss we share today.

1:20:19.708 --> 1:20:21.583
May peace reign here a while, hmm?

1:20:22.167 --> 1:20:24.042
And let their spirits rest in Heaven.

1:20:24.542 --> 1:20:31.292
[Lord Capulet] May angels sing their
praises in their resting place. [gasps]

1:20:31.875 --> 1:20:35.750
Let their names be inscribed in marble
across the land.

1:20:35.833 --> 1:20:36.833
[Lord Capulet] Good marble.

1:20:36.917 --> 1:20:40.792
[Lord Montague] Expensive marble.
Rich Corinthian marble. Porphyry.

1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:42.625
Porphyry's good.

1:20:42.708 --> 1:20:44.542
-And even wood.
-[mouthing] What?

1:20:44.625 --> 1:20:45.625
[Lord Capulet] Wood?

1:20:45.708 --> 1:20:49.333
[Lord Montague] Wooden doors,
no, church doors. Fountains.

1:20:49.417 --> 1:20:52.292
-Mmm. Good call.
-Oh, w-what? Oh, she's alive!

1:20:52.375 --> 1:20:55.708
-[Lord Capulet] My daughter?
-[Lady Capulet gasps, chuckles]

1:20:55.792 --> 1:20:56.958
[all gasps, clamors]

1:20:57.042 --> 1:20:59.417
-Romeo, [breathes heavily] Romeo!
-[gasps]

1:21:00.417 --> 1:21:05.250
I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison
yet doth remain on them. [inhales sharply]

1:21:05.333 --> 1:21:06.833
-Juliet, no!
-No! Uh--

1:21:06.917 --> 1:21:08.708
[kisses, breathes heavily]

1:21:08.792 --> 1:21:10.458
Thy lips are warm.

1:21:10.542 --> 1:21:14.167
-[pants, groans]
-Ju--

1:21:16.417 --> 1:21:17.417
[gasps]

1:21:17.500 --> 1:21:18.917
Okay, what the hell was that?

1:21:19.417 --> 1:21:21.000
Is there a doctor in the house?

1:21:21.083 --> 1:21:23.833
Yeah, yeah,
we'd like to have some confirmation.

1:21:23.917 --> 1:21:26.042
Step aside. Step aside.

1:21:26.125 --> 1:21:29.000
Thank you. Thank you.
Professional coming through.

1:21:32.417 --> 1:21:33.500
[clears throat]

1:21:38.833 --> 1:21:39.917
Yes.

1:21:40.958 --> 1:21:42.833
They are definitely dead.

1:21:42.917 --> 1:21:45.167
-[Lady Capulet] Oh!
-How can you be sure?

1:21:45.917 --> 1:21:47.292
How can I be sure?

1:21:48.208 --> 1:21:53.708
For the love of God,
I am a registered bloody nurse!

1:21:54.333 --> 1:21:55.833
I thought that was just your name.

1:21:55.917 --> 1:21:57.458
No, my name's Janet.

1:21:58.625 --> 1:22:01.083
Well, Montagues, Capulets, anon.

1:22:01.167 --> 1:22:02.667
Capulets, anon.

1:22:02.750 --> 1:22:04.875
Capulets, anon.

1:22:05.708 --> 1:22:07.708
Mmm, they couldn't--

1:22:08.542 --> 1:22:10.208
They couldn't live in peace.

1:22:12.417 --> 1:22:14.167
At least let them rest in it.

1:22:19.083 --> 1:22:20.292
[all chattering]

1:22:20.375 --> 1:22:24.250
Let us take our leave
of this dreary scene.

1:22:24.917 --> 1:22:26.917
[Lord Montague] I know a very fine spot.

1:22:28.917 --> 1:22:30.042
[footsteps departing]

1:22:30.125 --> 1:22:32.708
[sighs]

1:22:37.875 --> 1:22:39.875
Okay, they're gone. You can wake up now.

1:22:39.958 --> 1:22:41.500
-[pants]
-[gasps]

1:22:41.583 --> 1:22:42.583
[Rosaline chuckles]

1:22:42.667 --> 1:22:44.000
I love you so much.

1:22:44.083 --> 1:22:47.125
-I love you so much more.
-[sighs] I love you so much more.

1:22:47.208 --> 1:22:48.542
[both chuckle]

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.083
Tell me the truth.

1:22:57.542 --> 1:22:59.458
You could be halfway to Venice by now.

1:23:00.625 --> 1:23:01.875
What made you come back?

1:23:04.917 --> 1:23:06.083
I don't know.

1:23:06.167 --> 1:23:09.333
There's just something about you
that makes me do stupid things.

1:23:13.958 --> 1:23:15.001
[waves crashing]

1:23:16.583 --> 1:23:21.875
[seagulls squawking]

1:23:21.958 --> 1:23:24.792
Well, I'll never forget you, Rosaline.

1:23:24.875 --> 1:23:26.167
Back at you, Romeo.

1:23:26.250 --> 1:23:27.417
It's been real.

1:23:27.958 --> 1:23:30.167
Get in here. Ah.

1:23:35.625 --> 1:23:36.625
Okay.

1:23:36.708 --> 1:23:42.917
So, you should plan to land
at Paphos Harbor.

1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.500
But if the wind picks up
and you end up at the Meleti Forest,

1:23:45.583 --> 1:23:47.375
that's also supposed to be really great.

1:23:48.750 --> 1:23:49.750
[sighs]

1:23:50.458 --> 1:23:55.375
Thank you, Rosaline, for everything.

1:23:57.375 --> 1:23:58.625
What are cousins for?

1:24:00.375 --> 1:24:01.208
[chuckles]

1:24:01.875 --> 1:24:02.958
-[chuckles]
-[grunts]

1:24:06.083 --> 1:24:09.542
Whilst the Heavens and Earth
circle vermilion stars, so are--

1:24:09.625 --> 1:24:11.042
Romeo, just get in the boat.

1:24:11.125 --> 1:24:12.250
Yes, milady.

1:24:15.750 --> 1:24:18.292
-Okay, buddy.
-And you-- [stammers, clears throat]

1:24:18.792 --> 1:24:20.792
[chuckles] Thank you.

1:24:21.875 --> 1:24:24.000
Okay. [pants]

1:24:26.417 --> 1:24:27.417
[kisses]

1:24:32.208 --> 1:24:33.208
[sighs]

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:48.625
I'm really gonna miss that boat.

1:24:49.167 --> 1:24:50.167
I know.

1:24:54.833 --> 1:24:56.292
Have you ever been to Cyprus?

1:24:56.792 --> 1:24:58.167
No. Have you?

1:24:58.250 --> 1:24:59.250
No.

1:25:04.708 --> 1:25:05.708
It's an island.

1:25:07.167 --> 1:25:08.167
Yeah.

1:25:08.667 --> 1:25:09.667
Mmm.

1:25:15.458 --> 1:25:16.292
[sighs]

1:25:25.625 --> 1:25:26.875
Let me ask you something.

1:25:29.125 --> 1:25:30.125
Yeah?

1:25:31.458 --> 1:25:35.042
Would you, uh, ever--

1:25:37.042 --> 1:25:41.958
You know, if I got another boat.
[sighs] Maybe wanna--

1:25:56.750 --> 1:25:57.750
I'll think about it.

1:26:16.792 --> 1:26:20.792
You know, centuries from now,
when everyone's telling this story,

1:26:21.667 --> 1:26:23.792
you think you and I
will even be mentioned?

1:26:26.833 --> 1:26:31.375
Honestly… I couldn't care less.

1:26:33.458 --> 1:26:34.458
Me neither.

1:26:34.542 --> 1:26:36.625
[pop song begins]

1:27:14.792 --> 1:27:15.792
Do you like sports?

1:27:17.208 --> 1:27:20.042
Um, not really.

1:27:20.958 --> 1:27:21.958
Okay.

1:27:25.083 --> 1:27:26.083
Food?

1:27:26.750 --> 1:27:27.750
What?

1:27:28.708 --> 1:27:32.917
Do you like food?

1:27:34.375 --> 1:27:35.708
Do I like food?

1:27:35.792 --> 1:27:39.042
Like, what's your favorite food?
What would your favorite food be?

1:27:42.125 --> 1:27:43.417
I like-- I like pizza.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.250
-Oh.
-Uh, probably pizza.

1:27:45.333 --> 1:27:46.333
Mm-hmm.

1:27:47.583 --> 1:27:49.500
[sucks teeth]

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.792
Mmm. [groaning]

1:27:56.292 --> 1:27:57.375
You don't like pizza?

1:27:57.458 --> 1:27:59.625
I am lactose intolerant.

1:28:07.333 --> 1:28:08.333
I like veal.

1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.500
Baby cow?

1:28:11.583 --> 1:28:12.583
Is it?

1:28:14.125 --> 1:28:15.125
Oh.

1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.833
Just seven more hours to go.

1:28:26.375 --> 1:28:31.083
Then… the rest of our lives.

1:28:33.125 --> 1:28:34.125
[Juliet] Right.

1:28:35.875 --> 1:28:36.875
Yes.

1:28:44.250 --> 1:28:47.042
[pop song ends]
