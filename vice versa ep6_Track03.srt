Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:21,013
If this movie was aired in our universe,

5
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:22,691
it would make millions by now.

6
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:25,101
If it wasn’t for you, this movie wouldn’t have happened.

7
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:27,130
It’s life to meet and part.

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,024
I’m so proud to work with you guys.

9
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:30,916
What are you gonna do now?

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,680
I’m moving back home.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,968
If I stop writing screenplays, I won’t be able to cover the rent.

12
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:40,000
Talay,

13
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:43,056
would you like to move in with me?

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,612
Your clothes are colorful.

15
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:06,745
They’re making my room a lot livelier.

16
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:10,810
Wait.

17
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,410
Not my room anymore.

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,352
Our room.

19
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,080
What are you saying?

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,341
I’m getting goosebumps.

21
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:24,560
You said you would watch a movie.

22
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,488
I am.

23
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:31,280
I prepared popped rice for you already.

24
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:44,680
Tun!

25
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,673
Why don’t you eat it normally?

26
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,020
I don’t want my hands messy.

27
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,635
Can I borrow yours?

28
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:04,724
My hands are clean.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,344
I won’t be the only one with sticky hands.

30
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:11,240
What?

31
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,000
We should stop eating popped rice.

32
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,654
Better eat something else.

33
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,600
We should stop watching the movie.

34
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,725
Let’s get ready for bed.

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,024
Here.

36
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:52,954
Do you know who puts toothpaste on each other’s toothbrushes?

37
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,458
Who?

38
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
Come on. Think.

39
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,041
Anyone.

40
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:08,620
Who is the last person we see before bed

41
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:12,112
and the first person we see after waking up?

42
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,623
Can’t be anyone else.

43
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:18,000
Tun, what are you saying?

44
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:22,101
Just brush your teeth.

45
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:46,888
Tun!

46
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:48,807
Enough.

47
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,640
That latter part doesn’t sound right.

48
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,280
Do you want me to live with you or do you want something 18+?

49
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,298
Come on.

50
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:00,590
Anything can happen.

51
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:02,887
No.

52
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:06,508
Us living together will result in fighting all the time.

53
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:16,636
Tun.

54
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,092
About the rental,

55
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,241
I can help you pay.

56
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:23,908
No.

57
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:29,612
I’d feel bad if you just pay and don’t live there with me.

58
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,998
Besides,

59
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,401
the reason I want you to move in with me

60
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:47,232
is that I’m feeling a bit lost as I won’t get to spend time with you anymore.

61
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:54,000
Seeing you 24/7 is heartwarming.

62
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,004
You should spend time with someone else too.

63
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,284
You might find your portkey.

64
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:09,967
Don’t you want to go back?

65
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:22,666
I still can’t find my portkey.

66
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:28,087
Damn it! I just want to drink so bad.

67
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,529
There, there. Let me give you a warm hug.

68
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,312
Spend the night with me. I’ll give you free fried chicken.

69
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:37,419
That’s enough. Come here.

70
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,764
Do not take advantage of him.

71
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:39,791
Come here.

72
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:41,220
Here.

73
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,894
Why stopping me?

74
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:45,016
Sit tight.

75
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:47,455
I’m pretty lonely these days.

76
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,887
Tun has been gone. He doesn’t come at all.

77
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Where is Tun, Talay?

78
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,149
No idea.

79
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:59,437
Since we disbanded, I haven’t seen him.

80
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,525
He doesn’t pick up my calls.

81
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:06,676
I haven’t seen him for a week.

82
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,939
My heart is shattered.

83
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,559
Too much. It’s just a week.

84
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,410
Not just a week.

85
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:18,800
It’s 168 hours or 10,080 minutes or…

86
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,966
Enough.

87
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,720
Do you miss him that much?

88
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:24,435
You don’t get it.

89
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:28,863
When we miss someone, a minute feels like a year.

90
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:30,922
Right, Talay?

91
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,463
- Me?
- Yes.

92
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,703
You two always stick together.

93
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:41,690
If one is missing, the other one can’t help but feel a bit empty.

94
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,525
Can you sing for me?

95
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:09,706
I want to hear music from our universe.

96
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:11,838
Sing it yourself.

97
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,048
I want to hear a song you sing.

98
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:20,308
I’m playing games.

99
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:23,038
Please, Talay.

100
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,803
It can be your favorite song.

101
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,470
The one by Paradox.

102
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:28,900
‘Love.’

103
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,201
No ‘Love’ now.

104
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:32,415
Let me play this game first.

105
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,640
You’re mean.

106
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:16,840
Yeah! The exams are all over.

107
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,479
Right.

108
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:22,188
Studying for the exams was exhausting.

109
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:25,612
My agony is finally over.

110
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:28,484
Are you sure?

111
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,245
You can’t graduate yet, Tess.

112
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:33,842
Why can’t I?

113
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,125
I have lots of accumulated scores.

114
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:38,042
I won’t get an F.

115
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:40,129
Not this term’s courses.

116
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,175
Did you forget you’re missing one more course?

117
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,062
Right.

118
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,680
You said you didn’t want to study too much.

119
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,948
So you didn’t enroll in the last English course.

120
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:48,961
You have to study alone now.

121
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,201
How lonely!

122
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:56,763
Right.

123
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:58,885
How lonely.

124
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:07,052
Why do people around me keep on missing?

125
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,279
So dramatic.

126
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:10,954
Let’s leave.

127
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,158
Let him play his music video.

128
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:32,267
Ahem.

129
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,234
Tun?

130
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,548
We see you’re lonely so we’re keeping you company.

131
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:37,033
We’ve got some beers.

132
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,151
Come one.

133
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,581
Let’s drink and watch a movie.

134
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,960
It’s a long night tonight.

135
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:46,515
Let’s watch the one you made.

136
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,283
It just hit the streaming app.

137
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,150
Sure.

138
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:03,202
I designed the ending scene already.

139
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:08,464
After the lead characters parted, they run into each other here one day.

140
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,342
It’s my first snow in life.

141
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,467
That means I’m the first one you see snow with.

142
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,132
If this movie was aired in our universe,

143
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,467
it would make millions by now.

144
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,406
If it wasn’t for you,

145
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:30,746
this movie wouldn’t have happened.

146
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:33,401
I’m going to bed.

147
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:35,633
Drowsy.

148
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,358
Tun.

149
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,684
I’m starving, Tess.

150
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,127
Let’s go eat.

151
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:19,588
Wake up.

152
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,889
He’s never been a morning person.

153
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:27,560
We must play hardball.

154
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:30,968
Ready?

155
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:34,306
1, 2, 3.

156
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:36,248
Tickle. Tickle.

157
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:49,338
Who are you here for?

158
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:51,360
Is Tun home?

159
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,838
He’s been like this since he got back.

160
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:07,352
Spending alone time in his room, not associating with anyone.

161
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,862
It’s good you’re here, Tess. Please deal with him.

162
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:15,898
Tun.

163
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:29,151
Talay.

164
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,148
What brought you here?

165
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:36,413
It hasn’t even been that long but you look a lot older.

166
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,650
Your ears are deaf.

167
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,240
And look.

168
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,080
Your mustache has turned white.

169
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,463
Yeah.

170
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,680
Now you’re as old as me.

171
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,256
What are you listening to?

172
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:04,691
Some music.

173
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:09,315
But I don’t know any of the songs in this universe.

174
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:13,364
♪ Oh dear love ♪

175
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,412
♪ Please look at me ♪

176
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:24,831
♪ Sometimes we meet on a heartbreaking day ♪

177
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:33,065
♪ You come in and embrace me softly ♪

178
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:36,233
♪ Oh dear love ♪

179
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,035
♪ Sweet love ♪

180
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:47,155
♪ You’re a beauty, my heart gets carried away ♪

181
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,701
♪ Look at you ♪

182
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:52,820
♪ Where are you? ♪

183
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:58,239
♪ Oh dear love, I want to meet you ♪

184
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:04,508
♪ You can do anything ♪

185
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:12,192
♪ Oh dear love, I love you ♪

186
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,729
The song you wanted to hear.

187
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:23,120
I played it.

188
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,978
I should leave now.

189
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,736
You came all the way here just to play me that song?

190
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:34,881
You’ve been gone for 9 days.

191
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:42,840
Do you have any idea how long 12,960 minutes I waited for you felt like?

192
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:46,549
Tun.

193
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:48,756
I…

194
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,331
I freaking missed you.

195
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:57,854
I know.

196
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:01,270
Because for me,

197
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:07,043
it was 777,600 seconds that I spent missing you like crazy too.

198
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:38,909
What about you?

199
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,416
What did you miss about me?

200
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:41,638
I miss…

201
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,720
your annoyance,

202
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:45,486
your care,

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
and lastly,

204
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,218
just you.

205
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,687
Hey!

206
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:24,309
I have a question.

207
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:26,971
Why did you disappear?

208
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:29,859
I don’t have much money left.

209
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,712
And I don’t want to bother Pakorn’s parents.

210
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,827
I tried to save money as much as I could.

211
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,552
I stayed in.

212
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,645
I didn’t contact anyone.

213
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:44,367
I didn’t go anywhere.

214
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,056
I only ate at home.

215
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:48,879
Is it that bad?

216
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,922
Then why didn’t you answer my calls?

217
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,265
Because if you said you wanted to see me

218
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:02,618
or if I heard your voice,

219
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:07,939
I couldn’t resist going to see you, Talay.

220
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:18,911
I tried to find a new job

221
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,437
but there was no job I wanted to do.

222
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,396
Why not?

223
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:26,466
Because you were not part of it.

224
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:35,556
A life of doing things alone was not fun at all.

225
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,314
I think we…

226
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,828
Tun, Tess,

227
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,535
I prepared you guys some snacks.

228
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:45,671
Come have some.

229
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:47,837
Yes, Mom.

230
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:49,929
Hello, Dad.

231
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:50,835
Hello.

232
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,488
Glad to finally meet you in person, Tess.

233
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:56,920
Ever since Tun got home, he hasn’t talked about anything.

234
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,618
He seems to forget everything.

235
00:19:58,816 --> 00:19:59,816
He only talked about one thing.

236
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:00,913
You, Tess.

237
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,211
Really, Dad?

238
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:04,154
Did he gossip about me?

239
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:06,314
No.

240
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,603
He mainly said you’re great.

241
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,609
You’re so helpful. Like when he was put in jail…

242
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,654
Dad!

243
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:13,474
That’s enough.

244
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,494
Have you eaten anything yet, Tess?

245
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,891
Can I make you anything? You guys can eat together.

246
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:20,276
Thank you, Mom.

247
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:21,354
I’m just hungry.

248
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:23,932
Okay then. Just one second.

249
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,395
Honey, come help me.

250
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,672
Let the kids talk. Come here.

251
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:28,629
Of course.

252
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:29,493
Chop-chop.

253
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,198
Pakorn’s parents are lovely.

254
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,095
I guess this is such a warm family.

255
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,434
So lovely.

256
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:41,314
They always give Pakorn the things he likes.

257
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:43,337
Here.

258
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:45,037
Fill your stomach first.

259
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:51,306
Pakorn must like this very much.

260
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:02,981
I like it too.

261
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,081
I mean you.

262
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,653
What?

263
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,783
I like when you eat.

264
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,189
You make everything look so yummy.

265
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,393
Then I’ll eat them all by myself.

266
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:34,537
Who is it?

267
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:36,828
I’ll go get the door.

268
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:39,274
Don’t bother.

269
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:40,670
I just invited myself in.

270
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,845
I came very often.

271
00:21:42,394 --> 00:21:43,389
How have you been?

272
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,320
I missed you guys.

273
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:46,314
I brought you guys northern Thai sausages.

274
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:47,921
Up!

275
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,153
What brings you here?

276
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:51,582
I missed your foul mouth so bad.

277
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:52,401
I know.

278
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,645
I’m so proud of it.

279
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,474
Now that we’re here, should we call Aou?

280
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:57,002
Do it.

281
00:21:57,002 --> 00:21:57,948
Go ahead, Tess.

282
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,150
Hi, Aou.

283
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:06,958
(Hello. Hello.)

284
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:09,284
(What did you say?)

285
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:10,964
(I have no reception.)

286
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,466
(Hello. Hello.)

287
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,848
He’s probably doing some fishing.

288
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:16,951
He said he had no reception.

289
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,273
Uh…okay.

290
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:20,584
I just got my reception.

291
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:22,477
It’s nice and clear now.

292
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,450
Aou!

293
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,851
You. You. You.

294
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:29,965
Like that?

295
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,914
Hold on. I’m lost.

296
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,234
Is this destiny?

297
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,353
There’s no such a thing.

298
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:39,176
I destined this.

299
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:42,800
After you came, I called them here too.

300
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,952
Luckily, they are in Bangkok.

301
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,879
I freaking missed you guys.

302
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,154
Guys.

303
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:53,616
Friend Credits!

304
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,713
I missed this so bad. Haven't done it in a long time.

305
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,251
But first,

306
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,034
I need something to eat.

307
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:04,026
Stop.

308
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:05,806
You can’t eat these.

309
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:10,967
They’ve been reserved.

310
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,963
He said he would eat them all by himself.

311
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,208
No way.

312
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:28,911
Stop!

313
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,045
Nobody can have it.

314
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:33,386
Fine.

315
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:40,830
Friend Credits!

316
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:47,483
What?

317
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:49,434
It sparkled for a few seconds.

318
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:52,972
The sparkler?

319
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:54,449
You want more?

320
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:56,766
I meant us.

321
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,209
We shone for a short moment.

322
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,547
But I think…

323
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:04,674
we can go further.

324
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,514
That was just one failure.

325
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,051
Should we make more movies?

326
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:10,165
Make more failures.

327
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:10,882
No.

328
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:15,827
How sad.

329
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,234
Because it won’t be a failure this time.

330
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,844
Yes!

331
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:36,961
What about you, Tess?

332
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:39,714
Would you like to work with us one more time?

333
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:41,219
Let’s do it.

334
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:42,826
Go as far as we can.

335
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:44,787
I’ll talk to my dad.

336
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:46,840
To our brighter day.

337
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:49,382
Cheers.

338
00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:52,554
Cheers!

339
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,136
You know, I missed you guys so bad.

340
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:03,274
I missed everything about you.

341
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,317
Every personality you guys have.

342
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:06,203
Like what?

343
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:08,066
You, for example, Up.

344
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:10,354
I missed your friendliness so much.

345
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:14,236
You make people smile while they don’t even have to ask for it.

346
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:18,501
And I missed your annoying aggressiveness and inappropriate behaviors.

347
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:19,640
You’re picking on me, clearly.

348
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:23,038
Hey, but I truly missed you all.

349
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:33,508
What about you?

350
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,561
What did you miss about me?

351
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:39,247
That’s tough.

352
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:40,938
Can’t think of one.

353
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:43,674
Nothing at all?

354
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,189
I missed…

355
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,713
your annoyance,

356
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:07,003
your shyness,

357
00:26:08,027 --> 00:26:09,581
your nice singing voice,

358
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,566
your care,

359
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,289
and lastly,

360
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:22,380
just you.

361
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:27,339
Hey!

362
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:30,634
You’re not sleeping?

363
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:36,584
I was.

364
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:39,944
But then I heard your whispering sound.

365
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:41,673
It woke me up.

366
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,614
Were you talking behind my back?

367
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:47,530
No.

368
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:51,123
Nothing.

369
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,553
Just sleep.

370
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:56,314
I can’t anymore.

371
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:57,886
Take responsibility.

372
00:26:58,307 --> 00:26:59,494
Make me drowsy.

373
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:03,681
How about counting sheep?

374
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:05,919
I don’t have any other ideas.

375
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,872
I read this from a book.

376
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:20,335
It says if we hear the sound of nature before going to bed,

377
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:22,661
we will fall asleep easier.

378
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,187
The sound of nature?

379
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:26,749
What is it?

380
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,432
Talay. (The sea)

381
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,144
I like the sound of the sea.

382
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:40,328
Whisper in my ear now.

383
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,597
What the heck are you doing?

384
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:04,593
Making the wave sound.

385
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:08,674
My ears are all wet.

386
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:17,213
Should we try patting your back and your butt?

387
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:20,014
I did it when I nannied my nephew.

388
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:23,401
I was about to say that.

389
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:25,914
How old are you?

390
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:33,597
I think you should just stop talking and you’ll be drowsy soon.

391
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,515
That’s a big yawn.

392
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,383
And now you’re the one drowsy.

393
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:57,331
Hey.

394
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,857
There’s one last method.

395
00:28:58,955 --> 00:28:59,997
Ear massage.

396
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:02,541
I’ll do it for you.

397
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,413
Um.

398
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:34,884
Good night,

399
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:36,613
Talay.

400
00:29:51,514 --> 00:29:53,834
Signs you’re falling in love.

401
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:56,600
There!

402
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,066
I saw that.

403
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,434
Who are you falling in love with?

404
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:01,526
Speak.

405
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:04,046
You’re wrong.

406
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:06,712
I’m just doing some research for my romantic movie.

407
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:08,596
Is that so?

408
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,114
Let me know if you need a protagonist.

409
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,705
I’m always up for it.

410
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:19,717
Now that we talk about it.

411
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:28,769
I want to know how we can tell if we like that person already.

412
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:33,544
You’ve dated so many people.

413
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:36,314
Why being so naive now?

414
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:44,611
I just feel like I don’t know love at all.

415
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,316
Sounds like a super dreamy dialogue from a movie.

416
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:51,994
To me, to want that person in life is considered liking.

417
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,811
That’s it?

418
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:54,880
Heck yeah.

419
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:56,429
Don’t overthink it.

420
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:58,394
Don’t complicate things.

421
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:02,975
So…

422
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:06,490
Who are you feeling it with?

423
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,474
I told you, no one.

424
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,737
You think I don’t know.

425
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:12,617
- You…
- Shut it.

426
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:13,916
Stop talking.

427
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:21,083
What are you afraid of, Tess?

428
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:26,194
You don’t need to be afraid of failing in the end.

429
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:30,468
What you should be afraid of

430
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:33,802
is letting that person slip through your fingers.

431
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:40,836
Whose RV is that?

432
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,754
It belonged to a friend of my dad.

433
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:44,545
How about we renovate it into a studio?

434
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:45,918
It’s an RV.

435
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,204
I’ve always wanted to have an RV.

436
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:49,304
Just like in this photo.

437
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:51,287
But I think it is missing something.

438
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:52,092
What?

439
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:55,535
Someone who’s willing to travel with you for the rest of your life.

440
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:35,707
What you should be afraid of

441
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,504
is letting that person slip through your fingers.

442
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,360
What the hell are you playing, Tun?

443
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:53,075
Are you playing a sad guy in a music video?

444
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:54,837
No.

445
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,787
I’m just thinking

446
00:32:58,517 --> 00:33:00,045
about our next movie project.

447
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:01,612
What are you doing here?

448
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:04,858
I was helping my dad water the plants.

449
00:33:04,964 --> 00:33:06,544
Then I saw you making an awkward face.

450
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:07,627
So I decided to watch you instead.

451
00:33:07,627 --> 00:33:08,392
Pleasing to the eye.

452
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:10,561
Get lost.

453
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:14,905
I said go.

454
00:33:21,762 --> 00:33:22,429
Tun.

455
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,383
Hm?

456
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,487
Whose RV is that?

457
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,387
That one?

458
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:30,952
It belonged to a friend of my dad.

459
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:33,759
My dad told me his friend needed money.

460
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:35,439
He sold it to my dad for a good price.

461
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:38,524
Your dad bought it and left it like this?

462
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,412
He doesn’t know how to make use of it.

463
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,760
It goes at the speed of a turtle.

464
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:50,032
Friend Credits doesn’t have an office.

465
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:53,661
How about we renovate it into a studio?

466
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:54,266
What?

467
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,841
It’s an RV.

468
00:33:57,176 --> 00:33:58,401
We discuss work inside.

469
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:02,557
When ideas run out, we drive out there for more inspiration.

470
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,003
How do we start?

471
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,197
Go up there.

472
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:09,429
Remove these vines.

473
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:10,892
Me again?

474
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:13,216
Just help.

475
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:19,887
We’ll keep the passenger seat next to the driver.

476
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:23,343
And get rid of the rest.

477
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:33,526
We’ll build a table and chairs right here.

478
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:35,608
Then on the opposite,

479
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:41,376
there’s a shelf for books and movie DVDs.

480
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:45,614
Hey.

481
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,701
Ouch. It hurts.

482
00:34:57,828 --> 00:34:58,556
Wait.

483
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,832
You’re drawing like you already have an image in your head.

484
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,565
Of course, I do.

485
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,265
I’ve always wanted to have an RV.

486
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:17,281
I used to think that when I’m old, I’ll drive my RV to places,

487
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,123
just like in this photo.

488
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,666
But I think it is missing something.

489
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:28,032
What?

490
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:40,380
Someone who’s willing to travel with you for the rest of your life.

491
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:55,570
The fridge is huge!

492
00:35:58,432 --> 00:35:59,977
Hey, I love it.

493
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:04,625
So you guys disappeared because you did it?

494
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:07,331
The fridge is mine.

495
00:36:08,223 --> 00:36:09,776
It’s for my luxurious drinks.

496
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:13,524
And I got the seat in the back.

497
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:15,088
Freaking comfy.

498
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,032
Since we’re all here,

499
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:19,260
I have a gift for our new studio.

500
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,773
What?

501
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:20,393
What is it?

502
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,359
Wait here.

503
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:25,352
What do you think it is?

504
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,461
Something expensive.

505
00:36:29,852 --> 00:36:30,831
I can’t wait.

506
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,552
In a note from the tree planting class I took,

507
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:39,462
a tree with a very nice meaning was mentioned. So I bought it.

508
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,751
A Pink Trumpet tree.

509
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:43,902
Hold on, Tun.

510
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:49,922
How big is a Pink Trumpet tree when it’s fully grown?

511
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,672
Around 8-25 meters.

512
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,171
Wait.

513
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:57,392
Are you planting a 25-meter-tall tree in an RV?

514
00:36:58,245 --> 00:36:59,116
Are you kidding?

515
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,225
Well, trim it.

516
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:05,952
Besides, won’t you be happy to wake up and see a pretty pink tree?

517
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:07,671
No.

518
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:09,432
I don’t think pink.

519
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:11,777
But its meaning is very nice.

520
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:14,392
It represents love and good wishes.

521
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:16,774
It fits romantic film screenwriters like us.

522
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:18,881
That’s true.

523
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:19,745
Aou.

524
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:20,245
What?

525
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:22,066
Let’s make room for our amulet.

526
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:24,811
Where should we place it?

527
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,146
Will it be good if we write about our life story in the screenplay?

528
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:45,501
I guess not.

529
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:47,646
Why not? It should be fun.

530
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,879
A man who travels to an unfamiliar world.

531
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:54,636
He is lost and lonely, and he needs to find someone to help him.

532
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:57,432
At last, he finds the one.

533
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:00,309
Then what’s next?

534
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,792
In the end, they…

535
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:05,335
Guys,

536
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,708
let’s capture you all on camera.

537
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:08,583
Come.

538
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,648
Just move a little left.

539
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,081
Snap me, Dad.

540
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:14,202
Be careful, guys.

541
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:15,639
Time for a photo.

542
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:18,873
You two switch places.

543
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,521
Better colors this way. Trust me.

544
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,052
I bought this so long ago that I forgot.

545
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:27,792
Glad I got to use it today.

546
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:29,384
Get closer.

547
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,810
Tess, closer. You don’t want to be out of the frame.

548
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,498
Sure.

549
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:36,096
In the end, they fall in love with each other.

550
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:38,274
What?

551
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:51,256
Will you spend tonight with me?

552
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:54,352
There are many things I want to do before I die.

553
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,950
But now

554
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:59,319
there’s one thing I want to do the most.

555
00:39:57,465 --> 00:39:58,689
Yes, Dol?

556
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,131
What?

557
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:03,648
A guide video for new universal travelers?

558
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:04,759
Yes.

559
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:09,795
Do you see there’re lots of new travelers here?

560
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:11,995
It’s overwhelming for Joobjang and me to explain over and over.

561
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:15,089
You graduated Film and Tun was an actor.

562
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:16,195
Help me.

563
00:40:17,613 --> 00:40:18,444
Please.

564
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:24,537
It doesn’t look nice here.

565
00:40:24,537 --> 00:40:25,917
Should be from this angle.

566
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:26,963
See?

567
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:29,542
I checked every angle.

568
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:31,012
This is the best one.

569
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,305
The video is too flat.

570
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:33,497
Should be here.

571
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,246
Why so stubborn?

572
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:36,553
Don’t argue.

573
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:37,715
I’ve had so much experience.

574
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,479
Trust me.

575
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:42,206
Trust me.

576
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,751
You can’t.

577
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:46,225
I had work experience.

578
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:52,733
When they fight, they’re like boyfriends. Right?

579
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:53,602
Yeah.

580
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:55,021
No way.

581
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:57,923
Boyfriends don’t hit each other like this.

582
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:00,844
True.

583
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:04,129
Boyfriends don’t strangle each other like this.

584
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:06,451
That’s right.

585
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:09,146
Boyfriends don’t step on each other’s feet.

586
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:16,155
So that’s what universal travelers call ‘ship.’

587
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:18,781
You go away.

588
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:19,542
Trust me.

589
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:21,240
Let me go.

590
00:41:21,423 --> 00:41:22,460
Back to work!

591
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:23,955
Okay.

592
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:27,293
The information part is done.

593
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:29,995
Now I want to interview universal travelers.

594
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:32,521
May I interview you two?

595
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:33,829
Is that a good idea?

596
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:34,955
Of course.

597
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:38,147
Help us. I’ll pay you with fried chicken.

598
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:45,906
My name is Talay.

599
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:48,932
In the other universe, I’m a colorist.

600
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:53,309
My name is Tun.

601
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,165
I’m an actor.

602
00:41:55,402 --> 00:41:57,964
How do you feel being a universal traveler?

603
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,648
At first, I was shocked.

604
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:07,638
But I’m glad sometimes because I don’t have to work so hard anymore.

605
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:12,138
For me, I was so stressed out.

606
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,040
I just got the job I’d always wanted to do.

607
00:42:16,852 --> 00:42:19,788
But then I traveled to the universe where I knew no one.

608
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:23,022
Lucky me,

609
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:25,344
I met Tun.

610
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:34,417
It was a funny story.

611
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,575
I just traveled here.

612
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:39,203
I was still lost.

613
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:42,589
Luckily, I met Talay.

614
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:46,367
He’s the light that saved me.

615
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,564
Thank you.

616
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:14,117
Thank you so much, Tun and Talay.

617
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:16,538
I’ll send fried chicken right to your house.

618
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:18,679
I’ll prepare my stomach for that.

619
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,540
You do that.

620
00:43:19,674 --> 00:43:20,912
Okay.

621
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:21,711
Bye now.

622
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:22,215
Bye.

623
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:23,372
I’ll see you tomorrow.

624
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:24,396
See you.

625
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,848
Come on.

626
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:30,775
Joobjang is so nice.

627
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,685
Right. I feel like I have another mom taking care of me here.

628
00:43:38,962 --> 00:43:39,736
Hey.

629
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:41,075
Talay.

630
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:51,125
(Thank you.)

631
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,761
(I wish you get to go home before me.)

632
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:55,321
Okay.

633
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:58,040
Let’s cut to the last part.

634
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,663
Joob, you talk and end the video.

635
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:01,058
Okay.

636
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:06,338
To all universal travelers,

637
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:12,904
I do believe universal traveling happens for a reason.

638
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,765
What are you thinking?

639
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:22,013
What do you think we traveled between universes to learn?

640
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:25,986
No idea.

641
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:31,235
Perhaps if we stay a little longer, we’ll find out.

642
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:37,998
Maybe…

643
00:44:39,531 --> 00:44:40,675
Maybe?

644
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:45,718
I traveled between universes just to meet you.

645
00:44:47,757 --> 00:44:48,522
What?

646
00:44:49,084 --> 00:44:50,319
Think about it.

647
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:55,235
If we didn’t travel here, we wouldn’t be eating fried chicken together now.

648
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,180
Duh!

649
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:01,355
Fried chicken is what I eat in whichever universe.

650
00:45:04,379 --> 00:45:05,054
Here.

651
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:08,760
Take a photo and send it to Joobjang to say thanks.

652
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:16,443
Come on.

653
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,545
Look at your face.

654
00:45:19,074 --> 00:45:20,236
Smile.

655
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:21,928
A happy smile.

656
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,015
Like this?

657
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:30,595
That smile doesn't say you enjoy the food.

658
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,532
It says you’re cute.

659
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:41,905
What should I do then?

660
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,655
Tell me.

661
00:45:45,302 --> 00:45:47,864
Here. Let me help.

662
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:50,799
Hold the chicken.

663
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:52,930
Smile widely.

664
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:55,235
Smiley eyes.

665
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:58,011
Yes. Chicken closer.

666
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,953
Okay.

667
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:02,542
I know it.

668
00:46:08,663 --> 00:46:10,574
Smile.

669
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:12,515
Smile widely.

670
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:14,283
1, 2, 3.

671
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:23,980
That’s the happy face.

672
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,442
Your eyes dazzle.

673
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:30,715
Don’t know if it’s because of the chicken or me.

674
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,566
Wow.

675
00:46:48,235 --> 00:46:49,675
You don’t wait for me.

676
00:46:52,384 --> 00:46:53,902
You keep talking and talking.

677
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:55,545
I’m hungry.

678
00:46:58,776 --> 00:46:59,599
Here.

679
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,597
Hold it.

680
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:17,740
Yes, Dol?

681
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:23,942
What?

682
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:57,795
Joob suddenly had a heart attack and passed.

683
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:00,595
She had no history of heart disease.

684
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:03,175
How did it happen then?

685
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:06,693
This symptom has been proved.

686
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:14,447
It should be that the person in her body in the other universe died.

687
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,131
So Joob died too.

688
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:21,409
It’s normal for universal travelers.

689
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:24,627
No matter how many of us have passed,

690
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:27,573
I never get used to it.

691
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:29,753
I get you.

692
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:35,763
Joob always said nothing in life was certain.

693
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:40,535
Whatever I want to do, do it now.

694
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:44,201
But I never succeeded in doing it.

695
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,392
What do you want to do?

696
00:48:50,322 --> 00:48:51,675
Tell Joob I love her.

697
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:57,607
I was too afraid to say it.

698
00:48:58,345 --> 00:49:00,345
I thought I had all the time I needed.

699
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:02,786
She didn’t know I liked her.

700
00:49:04,955 --> 00:49:08,507
She had no idea how much I wanted her to be my portkey.

701
00:49:25,735 --> 00:49:28,484
Okay. Let’s cut to the last part.

702
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:30,951
Joob, you talk and end the video.

703
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:32,926
Okay.

704
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:39,176
To all universal travelers.

705
00:49:39,592 --> 00:49:41,699
It is going to be tough at the beginning.

706
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,625
Don’t get discouraged yet.

707
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,860
Because you’re not alone.

708
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:53,646
I do believe universal traveling happens for a reason.

709
00:49:55,323 --> 00:50:00,908
Maybe it’s a lesson for us to learn something we're missing.

710
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:08,471
I stand with every one of you.

711
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:19,010
Tun.

712
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:21,406
Hm?

713
00:50:24,904 --> 00:50:28,161
Will you spend tonight with me?

714
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:40,697
Are you sleeping?

715
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:44,653
No.

716
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:50,715
Aren’t you going to ask why I asked you to stay over?

717
00:50:53,098 --> 00:50:55,098
Because you’re sad about Joob.

718
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,098
Partly, yes.

719
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:02,991
I’m starting to be scared of death.

720
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:08,756
Life is so damn uncertain.

721
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:12,926
I’m afraid that one day I’d wake up

722
00:51:13,707 --> 00:51:16,028
and people around me disappear on me.

723
00:51:17,092 --> 00:51:18,423
You’re overthinking it.

724
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:33,515
What I fear the most is that it happens to someone I care about.

725
00:51:39,816 --> 00:51:41,120
Especially, you.

726
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:08,996
I promise I won’t go anywhere.

727
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:11,578
Nothing will happen to me.

728
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,226
Someone like me doesn’t die so easily.

729
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:26,485
Thank you so much.

730
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:43,557
There are many things I want to do before I die.

731
00:52:44,735 --> 00:52:46,307
But now

732
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:49,666
there’s one thing I want to do the most.

733
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:55,079
What?

734
00:52:56,818 --> 00:52:59,219
Can I hug you to sleep all night tonight?

735
00:53:16,546 --> 00:53:17,797
Good night.

736

737
00:54:00,597 --> 00:54:01,821
What are you doing?

738
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,173
You look like you’re going on a date.

739
00:54:04,646 --> 00:54:06,646
I love it when you sing.

740
00:54:06,887 --> 00:54:07,638
Hey.

741
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:09,407
That’s my t-shirt.

742
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:10,732
Well, it smells good.

743
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:13,662
I won’t let you go back alone.

744
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:16,591
Because I’ll find my portkey too.

745
00:54:16,896 --> 00:54:20,474
Hasn’t it ever occurred to you that I’m your portkey?

746
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:22,822
This time,

747
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:24,931
I can kiss you, can’t I?
