-Sorry, sweetheart.

Welcome to the dictatorship
of the gayarchy.

303
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,000
No, Javi, no.

304
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,666
Besides, Àlex's vote doesn't count.
He's not a partner.

305
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,208
What do you mean, it doesn't count?

306
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,625
The next time,
I expect you to take my side.

309
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,875
Hey. Cover me quick. I'll be right back.

310
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,041
Do you know who that is?

311
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,041
-No idea.
-Hmm…

312
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,000
Forgive me for being so persistent.
I know what I want.

313
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,875
And I'm flattered by that, really.

314
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,791
Okay. So then, what's the problem?

315
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,833
Look. She's gonna support it.

316
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,333
She'll see it as a betrayal.

317
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,041
Hmm. And wouldn't it be worse
to betray yourself?

318
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,291
-[sighs]
-Look.

319
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,875
How about this, huh?

320
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,208
I'll leave you the contract.

321
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,458
Read it over carefully,
and tomorrow you give me an answer.

322
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,000
-Just let me have a few days.
-There's no more time.

323
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,916
We need this sorted before Christmas.

324
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,041
Don't let me down.

325
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,750
This chance comes once in a lifetime.

Hey, so that bastard Lolo hasn't shown
any signs of life yet?

329
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,625
After my message,
he must have blocked me even on LinkedIn.

330
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, don't worry.

331
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,333
There are plenty of other fish
for you in the sea.

332
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,375
And you won't have any problem catching
a tuna with a good belly. [chuckles]

333
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,541
-It's not that simple.
-Don't be ridiculous.

334
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,833
Most of the customers in this bar would
give an arm and a leg to be with you.

335
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,750
To fuck. Not to be with me.

336
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh yes, poor little thing,
you are so right.

337
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,708
How awful! It must be so difficult.

338
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,416
You know what I'm talking about.

339
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Look, kid. Don't complain about
being full on cake

340
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,750
when there are those of us who don't even
have any bread to put in our mouths, huh?

341
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,250
Or, rather, a good baguette.

[Àlex] Everything was easier before.

359
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,416
You'd meet a guy, you'd fuck,
meet again a few times,

360
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,250
and if you understood each other,
you'd just decide you were together.

361
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,250
Straight people do it.

362
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,666
If straight people do it,
we should be able to do it too.

363
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,583
I have a lot of friends who've been
together for many years, all right?

00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,833

Hi, yes. I'm sorry, but, uh…
You don't really know me 'cause…

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,666
Well… Well, I was calling
because I heard your message.

-Oh…
-Yeah.

At first I wasn't gonna call you back
because you seemed so upset.

376
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,125
But, after what you said,
then I thought that,

377
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,875
you know, it was important
that I tell you something.

378

It's true. I don't know
why you ask for my opinion

Really. [groans]

00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,041
All right, hold on.

389
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,125
So you called a guy that you've never met
before and haven't seen or anything?

390
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,208
Mm-hmm.

391
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,458

he turned out to be really kind.

but there will be others.

Yeah, I still can't fucking believe it.

00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,375
-What was that?
-[sighs]

398
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,708
No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

399
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,833
It's just, that before this guy,
I knew this other amazing guy.

400
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,916
He had a really great body, was nice.

401
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,250
I thought I had won the lottery
with him, honestly.

402
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,583
And what happened then?

403
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,291
He asked me if I would strangle him.

404
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,833
I mean, when he was about to cum.

405
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,083
And he tried to get me
to choke him like a murderer.

406
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,916
[chuckles] Well, to each their own,
I guess, right?

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,666
Yeah. Well, that's what I thought.

408
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,833
But, after that, he didn't want to cum
any other way, said it's not gonna happen.

409
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,625
I didn't wanna have to do that every day.

410
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,833
Especially not at the beginning
of a relationship.

411
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,291
Think about it. What about later on

412
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,416
when you really do want
to kill him though? [chuckles]

413
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,791
[chuckles] Man! And when I told
that guy that it was over,

414
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,250
he said that I was a bigot
and a homophobe.

415
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,291
Yeah, I mean,
the same thing happened to me

416
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,958
with a guy who wanted me to pee on him.

417
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,333
I don't think I've ever drank
so much beer in my life.

418
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,791
-And that's why you ended it?
-No, not me. He ended it.

419
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,041
Because he said
it was too small, in the end.

420
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,125
-Your penis?
-No, bladder!

Julia, you need
to go brush your teeth now. Move it.

429
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,041
No. I want to know
how Uncle Bruno's story ends, Mom.

-It ends badly, as always.

Hey.

432
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,333
Sorry. But it ends badly, right?

433
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,750
Look, almost all the guys I hook up with
either don't want to commit

434
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,541
or are in an open relationship
or cheat on their boyfriend.

435
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,958
And I don't want that.

436
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,708
You're a bit of a romantic, then.

437
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,333
-Right?
-[chuckles] No, no.

438
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,208
I just want to be happy, I guess.

[crowd chattering]

442
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,250
Do you know the legend
of the red thread of destiny?

443
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,708
No.

444
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:00,333
Well, it's an ancient Japanese story
that says there's an invisible red thread

445
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,250
that binds people
who are destined for each other.

446
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,916
It says that we all have one tied
around our little finger,

447
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
and that it can never break.

448
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,375
-But how do you know it's red?
-What's that?

449
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,500
I mean, if it's invisible,
nobody would know what color it is, right?

450
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,750
-It's absurd.
-Yes, sure, but it's a legend.

451
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,833
It isn't meant
to be taken literally like that.

452
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,250
Yeah, well, but you did.

453
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,583
-Yup. Well, okay… [chuckles] …yeah.
-Ah…

454
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,750
All right, I mean, isn't it
a beautiful metaphor though?
