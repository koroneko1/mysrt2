00:50.408 --> 00:52.783
This is nothing less
than 'Zeno's paradox.'

00:54.283 --> 00:58.867
You are Achilles
and the tortoise is the orgasm.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.867
Oh, come on.
- No, no, no. Listen.

01:02.033 --> 01:03.825
Achilles and the tortoise
are going to race,

01:03.992 --> 01:06.075
and Achilles is confident,

01:06.242 --> 01:10.200
so he gives the tortoise
a hundred meters head start.

01:10.367 --> 01:13.325
Now the mathematical problem
is that

01:13.492 --> 01:15.950
before Achilles
can pass the tortoise,

01:16.117 --> 01:17.325
he has to reach the point

01:17.492 --> 01:21.075
where the tortoise started
after a hundred meters.

01:21.242 --> 01:24.492
But when Achilles gets there,
the tortoise has already moved on,

01:24.658 --> 01:26.658
and then he has
to reach the next point,

01:26.825 --> 01:28.283
and the tortoise
has moved on again

01:28.450 --> 01:31.200
and so on and so on and so on.

01:31.367 --> 01:34.617
So Achilles can never reach
the tortoise and never pass him.

01:34.783 --> 01:38.950
And in the same way,
because you were giving chase,

01:39.117 --> 01:41.992
you couldn't reach satisfaction.
That's the paradox.

01:42.158 --> 01:45.492
I'm sorry, but it seems as if you're
not taking this very seriously.

01:45.658 --> 01:48.575
I'm telling you about the worst
thing that's happened to me,

01:48.742 --> 01:53.950
that I at that point, within seconds,
lost all sexual sensation.

01:54.117 --> 01:56.367
My cunt simply went numb.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.617
And immediately
we have to hear about

01:58.783 --> 02:01.242
this ridiculous
mathematical problem.

02:01.408 --> 02:05.908
In fact, I'm in doubt
whether you're even listening.

02:06.075 --> 02:08.449
Why do you doubt that?

02:11.617 --> 02:14.867
This is not a story I've told
in its entirety before,

02:15.033 --> 02:19.492
but whenever I've told other men
about experiences,

02:19.658 --> 02:22.700
episodes in my sex life,

02:22.867 --> 02:25.992
it was easy to see
that they became quite excited.

02:26.158 --> 02:28.700
I got excited.

02:28.867 --> 02:32.158
Yes, about the mathematical crap,
not about the story.

02:40.033 --> 02:43.867
What kind of a person
are you, actually?

02:52.283 --> 02:54.367
You wouldn't know.

03:00.492 --> 03:02.075
No, but I can guess.

03:05.742 --> 03:08.576
Why didn't I get that earlier?

03:08.743 --> 03:13.784
The fact you don't get excited
over my dirty stories

03:13.951 --> 03:15.993
is because you can't relate
to them.

03:18.409 --> 03:20.951
You've never been with a woman.

03:32.576 --> 03:36.201
That's quite accurate.

03:36.368 --> 03:38.701
Not with a man, either.

03:47.159 --> 03:49.493
Are you sorry about that?

03:54.118 --> 03:59.618
Well, yeah, out of curiosity...

04:00.909 --> 04:04.243
not out of lust,
as you would think.

04:09.993 --> 04:14.951
I consider myself asexual.

04:15.118 --> 04:19.868
Of course, I experimented with
masturbation when I was a teenager,

04:20.034 --> 04:24.284
but it didn't do much for me.

04:26.743 --> 04:30.451
So, there's nothing sexual
about me.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.868
It's not as uncommon
as you would think.

04:39.034 --> 04:43.743
And of course, I've read a lot
about sexual subjects...

04:43.909 --> 04:49.076
'Canterbury Tales',' Decameron',
'Thousand and One Nights'.

04:49.243 --> 04:53.076
You name it and I've read it
with great interest

04:53.243 --> 04:55.618
and enjoyment,

04:55.784 --> 04:58.493
but only literary enjoyment.

05:00.451 --> 05:02.909
But... but I think
maybe it makes me

05:03.076 --> 05:05.743
a better listener
to your story, and...

05:05.909 --> 05:12.618
I have no preconceived notions
or preferences.

05:12.784 --> 05:16.368
I'm actually the best judge
you could give your story to.

05:16.534 --> 05:19.576
And when it comes to deciding whether
you're a bad human being or not,

05:19.743 --> 05:22.951
I'm... I've no problems with that.

05:23.118 --> 05:26.118
Because I don't look at you
through the glasses

05:26.284 --> 05:30.451
colored by sexuality
or sexual experience.

05:32.576 --> 05:34.701
I'm a virgin.

05:36.368 --> 05:38.493
I'm innocent.

05:59.034 --> 06:01.326
She's looking at me.

06:01.493 --> 06:04.368
Yes.

06:04.534 --> 06:08.326
It's an icon.
ls it Russian?

06:08.493 --> 06:09.826
Yes, it's, uh...

06:09.993 --> 06:15.034
It's a skilled copy,
maybe in the manner of Rublev.

06:20.368 --> 06:23.826
Icons are usually connected
to the Eastern Church.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.201
The Eastern Church?

06:26.409 --> 06:28.951
I might become a bit theoretical.

06:30.493 --> 06:35.201
You may. I'd like you to tell me
about your picture.

06:35.368 --> 06:40.284
Although the Christian church
was split up in 1054

06:40.493 --> 06:41.826
because of differences in opinion

06:41.993 --> 06:44.743
between the Eastern Church
and the Western Church,

06:44.909 --> 06:51.118
what we today call the Orthodox Church
and the Roman Catholic Church,

06:51.284 --> 06:54.909
this is a typical Eastern Church icon.

06:55.076 --> 06:58.076
It usually depicts the Virgin Mary

06:58.243 --> 07:00.243
and the infant Jesus
and more rarely,

07:00.409 --> 07:02.201
for instance, the crucifixion,

07:02.368 --> 07:05.493
which in the Western Church
was much more prevalent.

07:05.659 --> 07:09.118
If you generalize, you could say
that the Western Church

07:09.284 --> 07:10.868
is the church of suffering,

07:11.034 --> 07:14.701
and the Eastern Church
is the church of happiness.

07:17.368 --> 07:20.118
Why is she looking right at me?

07:21.701 --> 07:23.368
Well, she's telling a story.

07:23.534 --> 07:25.159
Icons were originally a kind of

07:25.326 --> 07:28.284
pictorial Bibles for the illiterate.

07:28.451 --> 07:30.493
There are some who say you...

07:30.659 --> 07:34.201
you read an icon, even write it.

07:36.243 --> 07:40.952
There are different types of icons.
This is a Hodegetria.

07:41.119 --> 07:43.452
The directions are very important.

07:43.619 --> 07:47.869
She's looking at you, but she's
pointing at the baby Jesus.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.035
And he's looking at you
and pointing at her.

07:52.244 --> 07:57.369
Do you see how flat it is?
There's no... no perspective.

07:59.285 --> 08:02.452
It's because it's an image of eternity.

08:03.535 --> 08:06.285
And eternity isn't in 3-D.

08:07.327 --> 08:11.369
But you said the Eastern Church
was the church of joy?

08:12.410 --> 08:14.994
Yeah, the sanctities
of the Eastern Church

08:15.160 --> 08:17.619
were all about the joy of faith

08:17.785 --> 08:21.660
while the Western Church wallowed
in... in suffering and death.

08:21.827 --> 08:26.202
If you imagine a... a mental
journey from Rome eastward,

08:26.369 --> 08:29.994
you feel how you move away
from guilt and pain

08:30.160 --> 08:31.660
towards joy and light.

08:31.827 --> 08:34.494
But you say
you didn't believe in God.

08:34.659 --> 08:39.909
No, but the concept of religion
is interesting.

08:40.077 --> 08:43.244
Like the concept of sex.

08:43.409 --> 08:45.244
But you won't find me
on my knees

08:45.410 --> 08:47.827
with regards to either.

08:47.994 --> 08:52.035
Let's call this chapter,

08:52.202 --> 08:55.077
'The Eastern Church
and the Western Church.'

08:55.244 --> 08:56.869
But it won't be...

08:57.035 --> 09:00.285
it won't be a story about
traveling east from Rome

09:00.452 --> 09:03.702
towards the light,
but rather the opposite.

09:03.869 --> 09:07.285
So, in order
not to make it too sad,

09:07.452 --> 09:10.785
I've pepped up the name of
the chapter with an extra title.

09:17.119 --> 09:19.077
I have to go back a bit.

09:19.244 --> 09:23.827
I was 12 years old and
on a school trip in the hills.

12:02.910 --> 12:05.869
Are you making fun of me?
- What do you mean?

12:06.035 --> 12:07.869
You have this orgasm,
not only an orgasm

12:08.035 --> 12:11.328
but a spontaneous orgasm.
- Yes, it was an orgasm,

12:11.495 --> 12:15.536
though the doctor described it
as an epileptic seizure.

12:15.703 --> 12:18.995
And during that orgasm,
you had this vision?

12:19.161 --> 12:22.953
Of these two women
on each side of you.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.536
The woman on my right side
seemed to be dressed

12:26.703 --> 12:28.870
in purple and scarlet

12:29.036 --> 12:32.036
with a lot of gold and pearls.

12:33.078 --> 12:36.203
She was carrying a golden goblet
in her hand.

12:36.370 --> 12:41.620
She was sitting
on some strange animal.

12:41.786 --> 12:46.495
And then the other woman
was dressed in Roman clothes,

12:46.661 --> 12:48.453
a baby on her arm

12:48.620 --> 12:53.495
and her hair lay in tight waves
beneath a veil.

12:57.078 --> 13:00.453
Was she holding the veil
with two fingers like this?

13:01.536 --> 13:02.786
And the other woman,

13:02.953 --> 13:07.578
was she sitting on an animal
with seven heads and ten horns?

13:07.745 --> 13:12.245
The animal only had one head.
It was kind of a bull.

13:16.661 --> 13:19.161
What's the matter?

13:20.786 --> 13:22.286
You're making this up.

13:22.453 --> 13:25.870
No, I'm not. I'm telling you
about my first orgasm,

13:26.036 --> 13:28.495
which came upon me
without the slightest touch

13:28.661 --> 13:32.245
in some strange ways
up in the mountains.

13:32.411 --> 13:35.036
I never had achieved
an orgasm before,

13:35.203 --> 13:36.286
even though I masturbated

13:36.495 --> 13:39.411
as if my life depended on it
during that time.

13:43.703 --> 13:48.828
Your story is like a...
blasphemous retelling

13:48.995 --> 13:52.995
of the Transfiguration
of Jesus on the Mount,

13:53.161 --> 13:58.120
which is one of the Eastern Church's
holiest passages.

13:58.286 --> 14:01.745
It's when the humanity of Christ
is illuminated

14:01.911 --> 14:04.286
by the divine light of eternity.

14:04.453 --> 14:08.286
Jesus, Peter and two disciples
had climbed a mountain.

14:08.453 --> 14:10.745
And suddenly,
the disciples see this light

14:10.911 --> 14:13.286
emanating from Jesus' head.

14:13.411 --> 14:16.161
And Moses and Elijah
appear by his side.

14:16.328 --> 14:20.870
And they hear the voice of God,
calling him his son.

14:21.036 --> 14:26.203
The relationship between...
between the two women and you

14:26.370 --> 14:28.745
would be the same
as the relation

14:28.911 --> 14:33.411
between Moses and Elijah
and Jesus.

14:33.578 --> 14:36.203
And that's where
it becomes blasphemous.

14:37.828 --> 14:39.203
I see.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.786
You don't even...

14:40.953 --> 14:43.828
you don't even know who
these women were, do you?

14:46.828 --> 14:50.536
No, but one of them did look
like the Virgin Mary,

14:50.703 --> 14:51.995
now that you mention it.

14:52.161 --> 14:54.078
Well, it wasn't the Virgin Mary,
I can tell you that.

14:55.453 --> 14:56.703
From your description,

14:56.870 --> 14:59.245
it must've been
Valeria Messalina,

14:59.411 --> 15:01.828
the wife of Emperor Claudius,

15:01.995 --> 15:05.620
the most notorious nymphomaniac
in history.

15:08.286 --> 15:10.745
I thought she looked
like your icon.

15:10.911 --> 15:14.036
We have that image
from a statue in the Louvre.

15:14.203 --> 15:19.453
It's made like a Hodegetria, but it's
not a religious person, far from it.

15:20.661 --> 15:24.370
And the other woman,
the one astride the creature,

15:24.536 --> 15:27.453
that was no one else
but the great Whore of Babylon,

15:27.620 --> 15:31.536
riding on Nimrod
in the form of a bull.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.203
If anyone else
would've told me that story,

15:38.370 --> 15:41.370
I would've seen it
as a blasphemous joke,

15:41.536 --> 15:43.203
spiced up with a Biblical light

15:43.370 --> 15:47.828
emanating from nothing less
than a spontaneous orgasm.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.911
Goodness gracious.

15:52.078 --> 15:54.786
You demand a lot
of your listener.

15:55.995 --> 15:59.453
I promise you I'm as innocent
in regards to the religious

15:59.620 --> 16:02.578
as you are when it comes to sex.

16:04.453 --> 16:07.203
The Transfiguration
on the Venus Mount.

16:09.953 --> 16:13.995
And then later,
you lost your orgasm altogether.

16:19.370 --> 16:21.661
Wagner.'Das Rheingold'.

16:21.828 --> 16:26.328
The descent into Nibelheim.
Was it that bad?

16:26.495 --> 16:29.661
Try to imagine that
in one fell swoop,

16:29.828 --> 16:32.036
you lost all desire to read

16:32.203 --> 16:35.536
and all your love and passion
for books and letters.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.578
I don't even know
if I can imagine that.

17:00.871 --> 17:02.412
Can I help you?

18:04.371 --> 18:06.579
But as so often before in my life,

18:06.746 --> 18:11.204
a bit of hope sprang
from a mystical event.

18:11.371 --> 18:12.537
Which was?

18:12.704 --> 18:17.287
Three dead leaves
performing a strange ballet.

18:17.454 --> 18:21.537
That gave you hope?
For what?

18:21.704 --> 18:26.079
For regaining my sexuality.
- How?

18:28.537 --> 18:31.037
To claim it by force.

18:58.912 --> 19:01.537
In spite of my tireless efforts,

19:01.704 --> 19:04.912
my cunt totally failed to respond.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.662
But the fact
that the initiative had shifted

19:08.829 --> 19:11.746
seemed to encourage Jerome greatly.

19:11.912 --> 19:13.787
And I have to admit
there came a time

19:13.954 --> 19:16.746
when we had fun together.

19:20.662 --> 19:22.871
I'll give you a fiver.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.037
Uh-huh.

19:25.537 --> 19:28.162
If you can put this...

19:28.329 --> 19:30.662
up inside your cunt.

19:30.829 --> 19:34.329
A fiver?
- Right.

19:47.996 --> 19:49.912
Shit.

20:32.537 --> 20:35.537
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:38.912 --> 20:42.579
Didn't you get any spoons?
- No, we didn't.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.830
So what does this tell us?

21:41.997 --> 21:45.080
That love and sex have nothing
to do with each other, or...

21:45.247 --> 21:48.163
or that they decidedly
work against one another?

21:48.330 --> 21:51.580
The most grotesque thing
was that it was during that period,

21:51.705 --> 21:55.955
where every sexual sensation
was denied me, a period,

21:56.122 --> 21:59.913
I must admit, of secure
and restful domestic comfort.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.913
We had moved in together
and so on,

22:03.080 --> 22:04.497
that I became pregnant,

22:04.663 --> 22:07.622
because I was careless
about my birth control pills.

22:07.788 --> 22:10.788
Consciously or unconsciously,

22:10.955 --> 22:13.955
it was important for me
to have a Caesarean.

22:14.122 --> 22:17.080
I mean, I was hoping that my cunt
was going to fucking work again,

22:18.163 --> 22:20.955
and I had a feeling
that a haphazard birth

22:21.122 --> 22:23.955
wouldn't make things better.

22:24.122 --> 22:26.330
I may have been imagining things,

22:26.497 --> 22:29.538
but as I lay there,
the noise from the instruments

22:29.705 --> 22:33.038
rang out in a chord like
the one from the Little Flock.

22:34.997 --> 22:38.163
Yes. And it wasn't fear.

22:38.330 --> 22:41.872
More like a kind of disgust.

22:55.997 --> 22:59.288
I could've sworn
I saw him laughing.

22:59.455 --> 23:01.497
A laughing son.

23:01.663 --> 23:03.247
In 'Doctor Faustus',
Thomas Mann describes

23:03.413 --> 23:05.913
the birth of Noah's son Ham,

23:06.080 --> 23:07.872
who was laughing when he was born.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.538
Another satanic omen.

23:15.413 --> 23:20.288
Incidentally, the innocent child
was named Marcel after Mars,

23:20.455 --> 23:21.830
the Roman God of War.

23:21.997 --> 23:24.080
And motherhood?

23:24.247 --> 23:28.455
I assume maternal love didn't
quite live up to its expectations.

23:28.622 --> 23:31.330
No, I didn't have
any expectations.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.122
And maternal love
wasn't a problem.

23:35.205 --> 23:38.705
It was just that each time
I looked into the child's eyes,

23:39.455 --> 23:43.955
I had this unsettling feeling
of having been found out.

23:47.330 --> 23:50.622
It's probably
a strange thing to say about a child...

23:50.788 --> 23:54.038
that my love wasn't being returned.

23:54.205 --> 23:57.122
But it was my perception.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.413
If Jerome had hoped for a break
from what was for him

24:02.580 --> 24:06.372
now mostly strenuous work,
he could forget about it.

24:06.538 --> 24:10.247
Achilles was again chasing
the tortoise.

24:13.622 --> 24:16.788
Fill all my holes.
- I can't, Joe.

24:21.497 --> 24:23.247
I'm sorry.

24:25.913 --> 24:27.788
I'm trying.

24:33.747 --> 24:36.747
Can we talk a bit?
- Of course.

24:41.955 --> 24:46.747
I love you. I love your wildness
and your desire. I love you, Joe.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.788
At the moment,
I don't seem to satisfy you

24:50.955 --> 24:53.038
in the way that I'd like to.

24:54.330 --> 24:55.205
Don't get upset, Joe.

24:55.372 --> 24:56.872
It doesn't mean we won't continue
with our sex life,

24:57.038 --> 24:59.372
which is very important to me.

25:00.747 --> 25:02.872
Very important to me.

25:04.663 --> 25:07.872
When you buy a tiger, right,

25:08.038 --> 25:09.997
you also have to feed it.

25:10.163 --> 25:14.830
Um, satisfy it, right?

25:21.580 --> 25:23.830
Long story short.

25:24.455 --> 25:25.955
I have a tiger on my hands.

25:26.122 --> 25:28.663
You mean I'm too much for you.
- No.

25:28.830 --> 25:31.288
You're just the way you should be.

25:31.455 --> 25:33.122
I was just thinking
if you would consider

25:33.288 --> 25:36.330
that I get a little help
with the feeding, that's all.

25:39.705 --> 25:43.330
You're saying I should have sex
with others as well.

25:49.498 --> 25:53.831
That's a rather cruel way
of putting it, Joe, but...

25:53.998 --> 25:56.373
But exact.
- Exact.

26:08.373 --> 26:10.831
For a long time I'd
been playing around with the idea

26:10.998 --> 26:13.331
that the concept of
the fuck-me-now clothes

26:13.498 --> 26:14.623
could be improved.

26:15.956 --> 26:17.414
You look nice.

26:17.581 --> 26:20.706
And became the piano teacher.

26:43.414 --> 26:46.456
You okay?
- No.

26:46.664 --> 26:49.498
What's the matter?
- Well, I'm such an idiot with cars.

26:49.664 --> 26:51.748
I don't really know what to do.
Do you mind helping me?

26:53.789 --> 26:57.456
Of course it won't work. The
spark plug caps have been removed.

26:57.623 --> 27:01.581
Yes, I did that.
Was that wrong?

27:01.748 --> 27:03.789
For the first time
I had the pleasure

27:03.956 --> 27:05.831
of having an eight-cylinder car.

27:05.998 --> 27:07.748
The possible combinations

27:07.914 --> 27:10.789
of eight spark plug caps
on eight spark plugs

27:10.956 --> 27:13.706
are 40,320,

27:13.873 --> 27:16.581
if I remember
my math correctly.

27:16.748 --> 27:20.248
And only one of these
will make the car run,

27:20.414 --> 27:22.623
which gave me
all the time I needed.

27:22.789 --> 27:25.664
Beethoven, huh?
He was certainly very good,

27:25.831 --> 27:27.539
but, you know,
he couldn't write a fugue.

27:27.706 --> 27:32.498
You think so?
- Well, yeah, I think so.

27:47.498 --> 27:50.956
It would be more precise
to say that Beethoven

27:51.123 --> 27:53.706
renewed the fugue.

27:55.039 --> 27:58.414
That he was such a visionary
that the old Bach purists,

27:58.581 --> 28:01.748
they accused him
of not mastering it.

28:23.956 --> 28:25.956
Good day?

28:33.914 --> 28:36.581
Not one word was ever spoken

28:36.748 --> 28:40.039
between me and Jerome
about my piano lessons.

28:54.248 --> 28:56.164
The first time the
mysterious letters

28:56.331 --> 28:57.373
addressed to me arrived,

28:57.539 --> 29:00.164
I, of course, feared that
they were love letters

29:00.331 --> 29:03.539
from someone I'd completely
forgotten about and hid them,

29:03.706 --> 29:07.539
so as not to hurt Jerome
if he should see them.

29:14.373 --> 29:17.748
But as Jerome was always somehow
present when I would get the mail,

29:17.914 --> 29:21.081
and as the envelopes
were always empty,

29:21.248 --> 29:23.289
I understood that the letters,
in fact,

29:23.456 --> 29:27.456
were sent by Jerome himself
as a way of testing me.

29:29.498 --> 29:31.331
My decision not to
show them to him

29:31.498 --> 29:34.123
was exactly the reaction
he had feared,

29:34.289 --> 29:37.123
and it reaffirmed
his insane jealousy

29:37.289 --> 29:40.748
and his fantasies
of the countless times

29:40.914 --> 29:44.456
I would fall in love for real
while being the piano teacher.

30:13.206 --> 30:14.831
And now to reach the heart

30:14.956 --> 30:16.915
of your suffering Western Church,

30:17.082 --> 30:20.290
I have to jump ahead
three years in the story

30:20.457 --> 30:23.582
and talk about my meeting
with what I would call

30:23.749 --> 30:24.999
'The Dangerous Men.'

30:31.374 --> 30:34.457
I was alone with Marcel a lot
during this period,

30:34.624 --> 30:37.499
as Jerome was traveling
most of the time,

30:37.665 --> 30:40.415
and when he was finally home,
he spent most of the time

30:40.582 --> 30:43.082
accusing me of neglecting Marcel,

30:43.249 --> 30:44.582
which, in my opinion,

30:44.749 --> 30:47.999
was just a cover for
his anger over my lovers.

30:48.165 --> 30:52.582
Despite my, to put it mildly,
promiscuous initiatives,

30:52.790 --> 30:56.249
any sexual satisfaction,
let alone orgasm,

30:56.415 --> 30:59.707
was further away than ever before.

31:17.999 --> 31:20.582
I had to make a change.

31:20.749 --> 31:22.624
And somehow,
the inspiration had been

31:22.790 --> 31:26.415
right there beneath my window
the whole time.

31:26.582 --> 31:29.915
I'd planned to go where
I would never before

31:30.082 --> 31:31.999
had dreamt of going.

31:32.165 --> 31:37.415
For instance, to be with a man with
whom I shared no spoken language.

31:37.582 --> 31:40.415
I could feel that
it turned me on enormously

31:40.582 --> 31:43.457
to imagine a sexual situation

31:43.624 --> 31:48.165
in which verbal communication
was impossible.

31:51.415 --> 31:52.499
Hello.
- Hello.

31:52.665 --> 31:54.582
I'm Tobias, the interpreter.

31:54.749 --> 31:57.207
Hello, I'm Joe. Come in.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.040
I understand that you mastered
the African languages.

32:00.207 --> 32:02.999
I do have a basis.

32:03.165 --> 32:05.124
Who and what needs
interpretation?

32:05.290 --> 32:10.499
Um, that man.
The one with the green jacket.

32:10.665 --> 32:13.165
What language is being spoken?

32:13.332 --> 32:14.999
Well, God knows. I...

32:15.165 --> 32:18.165
All I know is that
he doesn't speak English.

32:36.457 --> 32:39.207
It's quite difficult.

32:39.374 --> 32:43.457
But, uh, we did manage
to find a dialect,

32:43.624 --> 32:45.082
of which we both
had some knowledge.

32:45.249 --> 32:46.165
Mm-hm.

32:48.457 --> 32:49.582
You coming?

32:49.749 --> 32:52.374
No, I'll stay here,
and the two of you communicate.

32:54.457 --> 32:57.790
You are to ask him if he wants
to have sex with me.

32:57.957 --> 33:00.415
Sex?
- Mm-hmm.

33:02.665 --> 33:04.874
Yeah, um...

33:28.832 --> 33:32.207
ls it a go?
- It's hard to say.

33:33.082 --> 33:38.165
I've written down
the time and place, but, um...

33:39.040 --> 33:41.124
Honestly, I wouldn't like
to take responsibility

33:41.290 --> 33:44.457
for the precise wording
in this case, which I think,

33:44.624 --> 33:47.874
uh, accidentally may belong

33:48.040 --> 33:51.249
to a Grey zone in my profession.

33:53.249 --> 33:55.665
It was the address of
a cheap hotel.

34:04.249 --> 34:05.665
Why were there two?

34:05.832 --> 34:07.665
My words exactly.

34:07.832 --> 34:11.748
Apparently, N had brought
his brother along.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.041
Why was he so angry?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.833
Clearly, it was something
personal between them,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.708
but later I heard that
performing a sandwich

36:55.875 --> 36:59.083
requires great sensitivity,
since the men apparently

36:59.250 --> 37:01.750
can feel each other
through the tissue.

37:01.916 --> 37:05.333
I imagine the quarrel had
already started on the stairs

37:05.500 --> 37:08.541
and that one or the other party
had laid claim

37:08.708 --> 37:10.708
to one or the other of my holes

37:10.833 --> 37:14.375
in conflict with his Negro
brother's interests.

37:14.541 --> 37:17.208
You shouldn't use that word.

37:17.375 --> 37:20.208
It's not what you call
politically correct.

37:20.375 --> 37:21.416
Negro.

37:21.583 --> 37:24.375
Well, excuse me,
but in my circles,

37:24.541 --> 37:27.250
it's always been a mark of honor
to call a spade a spade.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.375
Each time a word becomes prohibited,

37:31.541 --> 37:34.083
you remove a stone
from the democratic foundation.

37:34.250 --> 37:38.958
Society demonstrates its impotence
in the face of a concrete problem

37:39.125 --> 37:41.041
by removing words
from the language.

37:41.208 --> 37:44.791
The book burners have nothing
on modern society.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.041
I think society would claim

37:46.208 --> 37:49.875
that politically correctness
is a very precise expression

37:50.041 --> 37:52.833
of democratic concern
for minorities.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
And I say that society is
as cowardly as the people in it

37:58.166 --> 38:02.041
who, in my opinion, are also
too stupid for democracy.

38:04.083 --> 38:07.750
I understand your point,
but I totally disagree.

38:07.916 --> 38:09.375
I have no doubt
in the human qualities.

38:10.791 --> 38:14.375
The human qualities can be
expressed in one word:

38:14.541 --> 38:15.625
hypocrisy.

38:16.583 --> 38:20.375
We elevate those who say
right but mean wrong,

38:20.541 --> 38:23.375
and mock those who say
wrong but mean right.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.833
Society is based on hate.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.333
It should be based
on forgiveness.

38:31.625 --> 38:34.250
Hatred is rudimentary.

38:36.166 --> 38:39.958
One should be able
to forgive one's executioner.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.833
By the way, I can assure you

38:47.000 --> 38:51.208
that women who claim that Negros
don't turn them on are lying.

38:51.375 --> 38:54.041
So, did they satisfy you?

38:54.208 --> 38:55.916
Those Ne... Negros.

38:57.458 --> 39:02.333
No, but they showed me that
there was a world far from mine

39:02.500 --> 39:04.791
I had to explore.

39:04.958 --> 39:08.000
And there, or perhaps
on the other side

39:08.166 --> 39:09.875
get my life back.

39:56.084 --> 39:58.376
Who are you?

40:00.459 --> 40:01.959
I know what you do.

40:02.876 --> 40:06.209
I'd like to be
one of the women you see.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.167
That's of no interest.

40:18.042 --> 40:19.792
Madame.

41:12.876 --> 41:16.417
Princess,
I specifically said five days,

41:16.542 --> 41:19.792
and five days haven't gone yet.

41:19.959 --> 41:25.834
So, you'll have to leave.
Sorry.

41:35.959 --> 41:37.959
You still here?

41:40.126 --> 41:42.209
I, uh...

41:43.126 --> 41:45.584
I don't think this is for you.

41:48.709 --> 41:53.084
Shall we conduct a small test?

41:56.459 --> 41:58.251
Stand up.

42:06.501 --> 42:08.292
Sit down, please.

42:16.084 --> 42:22.042
I just want you to sit
completely relaxed

42:22.209 --> 42:24.792
while I hit you in the face.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.667
Nothing special.

42:26.834 --> 42:31.167
It's just a...
it's just a slap.

42:36.626 --> 42:38.334
You ready?

42:39.834 --> 42:41.792
I'm ready.

42:49.001 --> 42:50.792
No!

42:53.834 --> 42:55.376
See?

43:06.126 --> 43:08.834
How mysterious.

43:09.001 --> 43:11.876
Will you give me
a reasonable explanation now,

43:12.042 --> 43:14.292
or shall we wait?

43:16.167 --> 43:17.959
I can't give you an explanation

43:18.126 --> 43:21.209
and certainly not a reasonable one.

43:21.376 --> 43:25.751
What exactly were the rumors
about him?

43:25.917 --> 43:30.417
That he was violent.
- How can that be exciting?

43:34.042 --> 43:36.334
I think the easiest way
to understand it

43:36.501 --> 43:39.126
is to refer to my rebellious nature.

43:40.709 --> 43:45.792
This business of K's was something
I was completely against.

43:45.959 --> 43:47.876
So, the fact
that I was now contacting him

43:48.042 --> 43:50.835
was a last, desperate attempt

43:51.002 --> 43:54.085
to rehabilitate my sexuality.

43:55.043 --> 43:58.418
The system was
the overriding factor with K.

43:59.293 --> 44:01.418
A system of violence?

44:02.210 --> 44:05.168
Well, you were the one

44:05.335 --> 44:09.127
who insisted on
the Western Church, right?

44:09.293 --> 44:11.668
And I... I seem to remember

44:11.835 --> 44:15.960
that the systematic approach
to the crucifixion

44:16.127 --> 44:19.710
is of a violent
and not to say sadistic nature.

44:19.877 --> 44:23.877
Oh yes, the Passion of Christ
is full of systematic violence.

44:24.043 --> 44:26.752
The Via Dolorosa,
the Nine Stations of the Cross,

44:26.918 --> 44:29.585
and the 39 lashes.

44:53.710 --> 44:56.502
You are beginning
to irritate me.

45:26.793 --> 45:29.210
Let me tell you the rules, then.

45:31.168 --> 45:33.627
The first rule
is that I don't fuck you,

45:34.585 --> 45:37.835
and there isn't any discussions
about that.

45:38.835 --> 45:41.085
Then, what do you get out of it?

45:41.252 --> 45:46.085
That's my business, and I don't
mean to mention it again.

45:46.252 --> 45:49.918
The second rule
is that we have no safe word,

45:51.085 --> 45:53.627
meaning that if you,
uh, go inside with me,

45:53.793 --> 45:56.543
there is nothing that you can say

45:56.710 --> 46:01.752
that will make me stop
any plan or procedure.

46:01.918 --> 46:06.918
You must bring a brown,
used leather riding crop.

46:07.085 --> 46:12.168
And not one
from a shop selling sex toys.

46:12.335 --> 46:13.960
It's not a masquerade.

46:16.210 --> 46:18.627
Third rule...

46:18.793 --> 46:24.710
If I choose to let you in,
you have to be sitting out here.

46:24.877 --> 46:29.418
In other words, you...
you won't know when.

46:29.585 --> 46:35.127
Only that it would be some time
between 2:00 and 6:00 at night.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.210
I can't stay here that late.

46:37.377 --> 46:41.168
My babysitter's not reliable,
and I can't leave my child.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.460
You don't even know my name!

46:45.627 --> 46:48.043
I'm not interested in your name.

46:49.502 --> 46:51.918
Here, your name is...

46:54.543 --> 46:56.335
Fido.

47:10.085 --> 47:11.627
Can I help you?

47:11.793 --> 47:14.377
I'd like to buy a riding crop.

47:14.543 --> 47:17.877
For what?
- For my horse.

47:18.043 --> 47:20.460
Yes, I understand that part.
What kind of horse?

47:23.002 --> 47:25.877
Well, it's not very big.

47:26.043 --> 47:28.502
No, I just meant is the whip
for dressage or for jumping?

47:28.668 --> 47:30.585
Um...

47:30.793 --> 47:32.293
I don't know.

47:33.418 --> 47:35.960
This is a dressage whip.

47:36.127 --> 47:37.960
Well, it's probably
for jumping, then.

47:38.127 --> 47:40.168
Okay. Like this?

47:44.252 --> 47:46.168
Is it used?
- No.

47:47.127 --> 47:50.085
We do have used whips,
but these are not that expensive.

47:51.752 --> 47:53.585
I prefer a used one.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.502
Okay.

48:04.668 --> 48:07.377
Marcel's awake.

48:07.543 --> 48:09.918
Do you want to say goodbye
to your mom?

48:10.085 --> 48:12.460
Goodbye.

49:11.503 --> 49:12.961
Fido...

49:35.044 --> 49:37.003
I'll take your coat.

49:57.419 --> 49:59.836
I'd like you
to have your hair up.

50:01.128 --> 50:03.836
You can use this.

50:04.003 --> 50:07.794
Just in case it becomes necessary
for me to hit you in the face.

50:07.961 --> 50:10.461
Should I take my clothes off?

50:11.961 --> 50:15.253
I'll tell you
what to do and when.

50:17.128 --> 50:18.753
You may sit down.

50:29.128 --> 50:30.961
Give me your hand.

50:38.336 --> 50:40.753
I wanna see what this knot
looks like on your wrist.

50:57.586 --> 50:58.878
Okay.

51:05.794 --> 51:07.711
You may get UP-

51:15.128 --> 51:17.878
Now you may bend down.
- How?

51:20.128 --> 51:22.044
Approach the chair.

51:23.753 --> 51:25.461
Now bend from the hips.

51:28.669 --> 51:31.586
Look forward. Look forward.
With your head up.

51:31.753 --> 51:34.628
Head up.
Keep looking forward.

51:41.336 --> 51:43.378
Keep looking forward.

51:47.919 --> 51:49.794
You may stand up.

51:51.378 --> 51:53.378
We have to use the couch.

51:55.919 --> 51:57.753
Come and sit.

52:00.211 --> 52:04.128
Take it easy. Take it easy.

52:04.294 --> 52:06.003
Bend over.

52:08.586 --> 52:10.794
Lay your arms out straight.

52:21.294 --> 52:23.586
Take it easy. Take it easy.

53:05.129 --> 53:08.045
Bring your hands out straight.

53:08.254 --> 53:10.462
Palms facing each other.

53:18.504 --> 53:20.087
Take it easy.

53:57.087 --> 53:59.295
Next time, don't wear knickers.

54:24.795 --> 54:28.004
Your ass is not high enough.

54:28.170 --> 54:29.337
I don't think
we can do this today.

54:29.504 --> 54:31.129
What?

54:37.962 --> 54:40.045
I'd like to see you again
on Thursday.

54:47.170 --> 54:49.504
What's wrong?

54:49.670 --> 54:52.337
I think we should see
how it goes on Thursday.

55:05.254 --> 55:07.087
Hi, I can't
come to the phone right now.

55:07.254 --> 55:09.379
Please, leave a message.

55:09.587 --> 55:12.420
Yes, this is Marcel's mother again.

55:12.545 --> 55:16.962
It's now 1:30.
We had an agreement.

55:17.129 --> 55:21.670
I hope you get this message
and come as quickly as you can.

55:23.254 --> 55:26.087
Ah, Marcel is sleeping.

55:26.254 --> 55:30.379
Uh... I have to go now.

56:26.170 --> 56:28.087
Raise yourself up.

56:31.004 --> 56:32.879
Even further.

56:36.712 --> 56:38.254
Better.

56:58.337 --> 57:02.337
Also so much better.
So much better.

57:08.754 --> 57:11.587
I am now going to hit you 12 times,

57:11.754 --> 57:13.920
no matter how much you scream

57:14.087 --> 57:16.254
'cause no one can hear you
down here.

57:23.670 --> 57:27.505
That's, uh, that's not how it goes.

57:29.088 --> 57:31.838
Most people don't scream
until I hit them.

58:33.630 --> 58:35.255
That's it.

58:39.380 --> 58:43.005
Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

58:54.255 --> 58:56.338
Hello? Are you there?

58:58.796 --> 59:02.255
It's just all so very strange.

59:02.421 --> 59:06.171
Yes. Very, very strange.

59:06.880 --> 59:12.171
Because I was wetter the second time.
There's no doubt about it.

59:12.338 --> 59:15.213
I don't know where we get
our sexuality from

59:15.380 --> 59:19.463
or where tendencies
of this kind come from.

59:20.505 --> 59:23.588
Probably a perversion created
in our childhood

59:23.755 --> 59:26.046
that never manifested itself before.

59:26.213 --> 59:30.630
Well, oddly enough,
Freud says the opposite.

59:30.796 --> 59:34.338
He talks about the polymorphic
perversion of a child,

59:34.505 --> 59:39.630
meaning that in a child,
all kinds of perversions exist.

59:39.796 --> 59:42.963
And then we use
the childhood to diminish

59:43.130 --> 59:45.713
or remove some Of them.

59:45.880 --> 59:49.171
Basically, a child
is sexually polymorphic,

59:49.338 --> 59:52.963
and everything is sexuality
in an infant.

59:53.130 --> 59:56.255
And yet it was deeply bizarre

59:56.421 --> 01:00:00.296
to lie there and especially
to want to lie there.

01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:07.546
I felt invincible.

01:00:07.713 --> 01:00:10.380
But mostly,
I felt like a potted plant.

01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:13.588
Potted plant?

01:00:13.755 --> 01:00:17.796
Yes, because he was constantly
checking my cunt juice.

01:00:17.963 --> 01:00:22.921
The way old ladies check their potted
plant to see if they need watering.

01:00:25.796 --> 01:00:29.796
It is an interesting point
that you actually lubricated

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:34.046
in expectation for a pain
that you hadn't experienced.

01:00:36.005 --> 01:00:38.921
Your body prepared itself
for an intercourse

01:00:39.088 --> 01:00:41.505
that you knew wouldn't happen.

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.088
I can only describe
the mood as sexual.

01:00:49.088 --> 01:00:51.630
Despite K's immature appearance,

01:00:51.796 --> 01:00:55.963
his methods were
surprisingly refined.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:00.630
As I twisted and turned
while he was whipping me,

01:01:00.796 --> 01:01:04.546
I could feel
how clever his knots were.

01:01:04.713 --> 01:01:08.380
If I fought them,
they would get tighter,

01:01:08.546 --> 01:01:12.463
and as I relaxed,
it seemed they did, too.

01:01:12.713 --> 01:01:15.213
Hmm.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:19.130
Like a cat playing with a mouse.

01:01:20.588 --> 01:01:22.880
Fooling it to believe
it has a chance of escape

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:26.463
and then attacking it again.

01:01:28.505 --> 01:01:34.088
I don't know
what kind of knot K used,

01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:39.505
but I know of a knot that tightens
when force is exerted

01:01:39.671 --> 01:01:42.421
and vice versa.
It's called a Prusik knot.

01:01:42.588 --> 01:01:45.463
It's after a man called Prusik.

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.463
He was a mountain climber,

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.296
and he and a friend
were out climbing

01:01:49.463 --> 01:01:53.796
and they had an accident,
and his friend died.

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:57.214
And he ended up hanging
at the end of a rope

01:01:57.381 --> 01:02:00.881
with no possibility
of getting up.

01:02:01.047 --> 01:02:03.672
You know, you can't climb
up a mountain climber rope.

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:05.631
It's too thin.

01:02:05.797 --> 01:02:09.172
But he was an intelligent man,
and with his back to the wall,

01:02:09.339 --> 01:02:11.172
he was a genius.

01:02:12.922 --> 01:02:16.131
And he took the shoelaces
out of his boots

01:02:16.297 --> 01:02:20.422
and made two loops
and affixed them to the rope.

01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:22.922
And he could move these up

01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:24.339
when they weren't under tension.

01:02:24.506 --> 01:02:26.797
And then he could step into them

01:02:26.964 --> 01:02:31.047
and climb the rope
and save himself.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.339
Prusik.

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:39.672
I think this was
one of your weakest digressions.

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:48.214
May I continue?
- Be my guest.

01:02:52.881 --> 01:02:56.964
Tomorrow bring 15 small coins,
all the same.

01:02:59.006 --> 01:03:00.964
No more, no less.

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:05.131
I sometimes give a Christmas present.

01:05:05.881 --> 01:05:09.547
But uh, you have
to do the work yourself.

01:05:09.714 --> 01:05:12.422
I'm going to show you how to do it.

01:05:27.339 --> 01:05:29.339
This is called a blood knot.

01:05:29.506 --> 01:05:33.839
You have to make nine ropes
with three blood knots on each.

01:05:34.006 --> 01:05:35.839
Let me see you do it.

01:05:36.006 --> 01:05:40.714
You decide whether
to make four, five, or six turns

01:05:40.881 --> 01:05:42.881
on the various knots.

01:05:54.089 --> 01:05:55.797
Let me see.

01:06:03.089 --> 01:06:05.214
That's fine.

01:06:05.381 --> 01:06:08.506
If you... if you start with one knot

01:06:08.672 --> 01:06:11.422
at the top of the rope,

01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:16.339
and then you have to put two
more knots at a distance of...

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:20.672
Well, between 10 and 20
centimeters to be exact,

01:06:20.839 --> 01:06:22.422
but the most important thing
with blood knots

01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:25.672
on the nine ropes is
that they are placed differently

01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:28.214
and that they are staggered.

01:06:34.132 --> 01:06:36.965
The cat-o-nine-tails
is often called

01:06:37.132 --> 01:06:40.007
the 'Captain's Daughter'
aboard ships.

01:06:43.882 --> 01:06:46.132
The blood knot is important

01:06:46.298 --> 01:06:49.048
because those are the ones
that break the skin and not,

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:55.423
as erroneously thought,
the end of the rope.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:07:01.423
A gallows knot is also a kind of
a blood knot with many turns.

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:06.090
The American military standard
demanded five to 15 turns,

01:07:06.257 --> 01:07:09.298
as it was the turns placed behind
the left ear of the delinquent

01:07:09.465 --> 01:07:12.673
that would break the neck
of the condemned as he fell.

01:07:16.215 --> 01:07:18.007
I'll take it from here.

01:10:08.548 --> 01:10:10.215
Joe?

01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:13.632
Love?

01:10:23.673 --> 01:10:25.048
Marcel?

01:10:28.923 --> 01:10:30.382
Marcel.

01:11:10.174 --> 01:11:13.216
Are you fond of me still?
- Yes.

01:11:13.383 --> 01:11:16.341
More fond of me than the others?

01:11:18.299 --> 01:11:21.174
Yes'?
- Yes.

01:11:21.341 --> 01:11:25.049
You're not thinking of leaving
again tonight, are you?

01:11:25.216 --> 01:11:26.424
No.
- No?

01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:29.049
No, no. Not at all.
- You sure?

01:11:30.633 --> 01:11:31.758
Yeah.

01:11:31.924 --> 01:11:34.674
Are you lying to me, Joe?

01:11:34.841 --> 01:11:36.716
No.
- Be honest.

01:11:36.883 --> 01:11:41.383
It's all right.
Just fucking say it.

01:11:41.549 --> 01:11:43.883
No, I... I just want to be here.

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:45.883
Why?

01:11:49.674 --> 01:11:51.549
I don't know.

01:11:57.799 --> 01:12:00.883
If you leave tonight,

01:12:01.049 --> 01:12:04.591
you'll never see me or Marcel
ever again in your life.

01:12:08.258 --> 01:12:10.299
You understand?

01:13:26.133 --> 01:13:27.924
ls this goodbye?

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:34.174
ls that what you're saying?

01:13:34.341 --> 01:13:35.633
Marcel, get up.

01:13:35.799 --> 01:13:37.924
Stop it.
- ls that what you want?

01:13:39.466 --> 01:13:43.091
Yeah, so you could see him.
Look at him, Joe.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.591
Let's face it,
Joe, you're not a mother.

01:13:53.591 --> 01:13:55.174
Let's wake him up.

01:13:55.341 --> 01:13:59.716
Marcel, baby boy.
Say bye, Mom.

01:14:00.883 --> 01:14:03.508
Please, put him...
- ls this what you want?

01:14:07.299 --> 01:14:09.008
You see?

01:14:09.174 --> 01:14:12.216
You see, he wants you.

01:14:12.383 --> 01:14:14.216
Come.

01:14:15.174 --> 01:14:18.258
It's Christmas.
It's fucking Christmas.

01:14:41.133 --> 01:14:42.383
What is this?

01:14:44.424 --> 01:14:47.674
Today it's Madame who must wait.

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:57.883
Madame, I'm very sorry,

01:14:58.049 --> 01:15:01.008
but I have to have a few words
with Fido first.

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:14.424
Your behavior is really
upsetting me today.

01:15:25.174 --> 01:15:28.008
I really ought to send you home.

01:15:49.925 --> 01:15:51.967
Happy Christmas, Fido.

01:16:54.259 --> 01:16:56.884
I want your cock.
- What did you say?

01:16:58.384 --> 01:16:59.925
I want your cock.

01:17:00.092 --> 01:17:03.675
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

01:17:07.009 --> 01:17:09.175
What's the matter with you today?

01:17:30.884 --> 01:17:36.425
On account of the holidays
and your behavior today,

01:17:36.592 --> 01:17:38.884
I'm going to give you
the original Roman maximum

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:42.050
of 40 lashes.
Are you ready, Fido?

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:45.800
I'm ready.

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:52.884
One.

01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:56.175
Two.

01:17:58.467 --> 01:17:59.509
Three.

01:18:02.009 --> 01:18:03.425
Four.

01:18:04.717 --> 01:18:05.925
Five.

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:09.634
Six.

01:18:22.967 --> 01:18:25.342
I'd seen through K's
knot technique,

01:18:25.509 --> 01:18:28.009
so I was able to loosen
my position a bit

01:18:28.175 --> 01:18:30.842
to move my pelvis
and thereby stimulate

01:18:31.009 --> 01:18:33.717
my clitoris against the cover
of the book.

01:18:59.092 --> 01:19:00.550
Forty.

01:19:11.259 --> 01:19:16.259
And when you came home,
Jerome and the child were gone?

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:26.134
I haven't seen Marcel since.

01:19:29.675 --> 01:19:34.259
This sentimentality...
I hate it.

01:19:37.509 --> 01:19:40.925
Why?
- Because it's a lie.

01:19:45.217 --> 01:19:47.050
Are you sure?

01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:56.050
Jerome understood
that he couldn't prioritize

01:19:56.217 --> 01:20:00.925
his life according to a child either,

01:20:01.092 --> 01:20:04.051
so he put him in a foster home.

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:09.760
My only contact to the boy
is the thousand pounds

01:20:09.968 --> 01:20:12.885
I put in his account every month.

01:20:13.051 --> 01:20:14.510
Anonymously.

01:20:17.676 --> 01:20:19.885
As a penance.

01:20:29.801 --> 01:20:31.010
Every time I leave,

01:20:31.176 --> 01:20:35.135
I have this feeling that
when I return, you'll be gone.

01:20:39.051 --> 01:20:40.926
And all I can hear
is the cat flap,

01:20:41.093 --> 01:20:44.551
swinging back and forth.

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:50.718
Thank you. I didn't know
you had a cat flap.

01:20:51.551 --> 01:20:52.760
I used to have a cat,

01:20:52.926 --> 01:20:56.260
so I have a cat flap
in the door to the stairwell.

01:20:56.426 --> 01:20:58.218
But how did it get outside?

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:05.551
I never thought of that.
I suppose through the basement.

01:21:05.718 --> 01:21:07.426
The thing is...

01:21:07.593 --> 01:21:10.426
Every time someone opens
the door to the street,

01:21:10.593 --> 01:21:13.676
the cat flap squeaks.

01:21:13.843 --> 01:21:15.676
There's a lot of drafts
in the house.

01:21:17.218 --> 01:21:19.968
It hasn't squeaked yet.

01:21:20.968 --> 01:21:24.301
No, there's not many people
coming and going.

01:21:24.468 --> 01:21:26.426
That's a bit creepy.

01:21:26.593 --> 01:21:29.801
No, I like it.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:33.843
It's... it's peaceful.

01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:43.843
After all this sadness, may I ask
what happened to the silent duck?

01:21:44.885 --> 01:21:48.801
Oh, shit. The silent duck.

01:21:48.968 --> 01:21:51.718
I'd forgotten all about it.

01:21:52.676 --> 01:21:55.426
One night K had been
in what was for him

01:21:55.593 --> 01:21:57.510
an unusually good mood.

01:21:57.676 --> 01:22:00.176
I don't know what caused it,
but he didn't hit hard,

01:22:00.343 --> 01:22:02.468
and he joked that
he would introduce me

01:22:02.635 --> 01:22:05.468
to the concept
of the silent duck.

01:22:30.718 --> 01:22:34.676
One hardly dare
imagine the quacking duck.

01:22:47.968 --> 01:22:50.885
Well, deep down,

01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:54.176
little K seems
to have been a jolly man

01:22:54.385 --> 01:22:55.551
with versatile talents.

01:22:55.718 --> 01:22:59.510
But he got that bit
about Roman punishment

01:22:59.676 --> 01:23:02.093
and the 40 lashes wrong.

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.885
Because it's true that
the highest punishment

01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:09.051
was 40 lashes, but it had to be
delivered in series of three.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:11.093
That's why Jesus
only got 39 lashes

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:16.885
because three goes
into 39 but not into 40.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.968
Well, I don't know about K
being jolly.

01:23:23.135 --> 01:23:25.593
His position as a sadist

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.885
wasn't perhaps as enviable
as it might first appear.

01:23:29.051 --> 01:23:34.093
Superficially, the sadist
acts as the decider.

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:37.843
But I once had a conversation
with a prostitute,

01:23:37.968 --> 01:23:40.468
who had tried all the variations
in her field.

01:23:40.635 --> 01:23:42.260
She wasn't surprised by anything.

01:23:42.426 --> 01:23:47.301
And she admitted to have only
masochists.

01:23:48.218 --> 01:23:49.343
Masochists, for her,

01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:52.468
were the most demanding
and the most ungrateful.

01:23:53.426 --> 01:23:55.843
First, she were
to deduce their desire

01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:57.718
by reading their thoughts,

01:23:57.885 --> 01:24:01.843
then perform without
any alteration from the norm,

01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:05.176
and after which,
unlike other clients

01:24:05.343 --> 01:24:08.676
and the most honorable sadists,
for example,

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:10.760
you never received any thanks,

01:24:11.676 --> 01:24:14.468
let alone gifts or flowers.

01:24:19.051 --> 01:24:21.885
I never went
in that direction again,

01:24:22.051 --> 01:24:24.510
neither back to K or masochism.

01:24:34.801 --> 01:24:37.511
But I took the orgasm with me.

01:24:38.927 --> 01:24:43.469
You yet have to show me one
single example of maliciousness.

01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:46.677
But that's all I'm doing!

01:24:46.844 --> 01:24:49.636
It's as if you want
to misunderstand me.

01:24:49.802 --> 01:24:53.427
You keep inventing
complicated and false excuses

01:24:53.594 --> 01:24:56.052
for my despicable
and selfish actions.

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:00.052
During the time
when our relationship

01:25:00.219 --> 01:25:03.052
was going downhill,
Jerome really tried his best.

01:25:06.261 --> 01:25:07.844
I bought you something.

01:25:08.011 --> 01:25:09.761
You bought me something?
- I'm sure you'll love it.

01:25:11.386 --> 01:25:14.219
Wow, it's a ring.
- Yeah.

01:25:15.261 --> 01:25:16.302
It's beautiful.

01:25:16.469 --> 01:25:19.594
It was impossible
for me to work out Jerome's income.

01:25:19.761 --> 01:25:23.636
Sometimes he had lots of money
and other times none,

01:25:23.802 --> 01:25:25.052
which I later thought perhaps

01:25:25.219 --> 01:25:28.511
meant that his work
was not entirely above board.

01:25:28.677 --> 01:25:31.761
But this time
he'd really gone all out.

01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:36.469
That must've been so expensive.
- Well, it wasn't cheap.

01:25:36.636 --> 01:25:38.719
Best craftsmanship.
- Hmm.

01:25:38.886 --> 01:25:41.052
I'll guarantee you that.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:43.677
Let's play a game, then.

01:25:43.844 --> 01:25:46.094
A game?
- Mm-hmm. Get up.

01:25:46.261 --> 01:25:47.344
Okay.

01:25:47.511 --> 01:25:49.719
It's called 'Cinderella'.
- I don't know it.

01:25:49.886 --> 01:25:51.761
You will.
- Okay.

01:25:51.927 --> 01:25:53.802
Right.
- No, you don't touch it.

01:25:53.969 --> 01:25:55.511
Okay.
- You just look at it.

01:25:57.969 --> 01:25:59.761
Okay? Are you ready?

01:26:01.302 --> 01:26:02.927
Yes.
- Steady.

01:26:03.094 --> 01:26:05.386
Steady.

01:26:05.552 --> 01:26:07.302
Go.
- Fuck! Joe!

01:26:07.469 --> 01:26:08.677
Come on, Cinderella.

01:26:08.844 --> 01:26:11.302
Oh, fuck.
- Come on, come on.

01:26:11.469 --> 01:26:14.761
Joe! For fuck's sake.

01:26:14.927 --> 01:26:17.094
Move!
- Cinderella, Cinderella!

01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:20.344
Fuck! Are you mad, Joe?

01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:24.011
Are you fucking mad?
Fuck!Fuck.

01:26:24.177 --> 01:26:27.136
Â£7,000, Joe!

01:26:28.886 --> 01:26:30.302
Did he find it?

01:26:30.469 --> 01:26:35.344
Oh yes, and returned it
and got all his money back.

01:26:35.511 --> 01:26:40.094
So can you call this game
anything other than malicious?

01:26:44.969 --> 01:26:47.636
Let me chew on that for a while.

01:26:51.594 --> 01:26:54.677
So it wasn't the diamond that
you're wearing around your neck?

01:26:54.844 --> 01:26:58.136
No. But that was a gift, too.

01:26:58.302 --> 01:27:00.219
But I have to be honest and say

01:27:00.386 --> 01:27:03.177
I can't remember the person
who gave it to me.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:07.094
I've always been in...
in the theoretical way, of course,

01:27:07.261 --> 01:27:09.261
interested in diamonds
and their cuts.

01:27:09.427 --> 01:27:12.302
The word 'brilliant'
refers to the cut.

01:27:12.469 --> 01:27:15.219
Diamond is the stone.

01:27:17.094 --> 01:27:19.177
If we use the word 'divine'
in connection

01:27:19.344 --> 01:27:21.427
with the Golden Section
and Fibonacci,

01:27:21.594 --> 01:27:23.719
the brilliant cut is nothing less.

01:27:24.469 --> 01:27:27.636
It's a frighteningly refined cut.

01:27:27.802 --> 01:27:30.386
Fifty-seven facets.

01:27:30.552 --> 01:27:33.719
The theory is that the light
enters through the top plane,

01:27:33.886 --> 01:27:38.136
which is called the table
or in some languages the mirror,

01:27:38.302 --> 01:27:42.427
and then inside the diamond
is refracted in all the facets

01:27:42.594 --> 01:27:44.427
and thrown out the same way,

01:27:44.594 --> 01:27:49.594
creating a absolutely unique
light effect.

01:27:51.636 --> 01:27:55.427
So, it's called a mirror.
I didn't know that.

01:27:56.636 --> 01:27:58.427
You have a mirror, too.

01:28:00.886 --> 01:28:02.594
Yeah.

01:28:02.761 --> 01:28:05.177
It's like a thought, isn't it?

01:28:34.802 --> 01:28:36.052
Some years later,

01:28:36.219 --> 01:28:39.427
the bodily abuse
began to have an effect.

01:28:39.677 --> 01:28:42.927
First, rare bleedings
from my clitoris,

01:28:43.094 --> 01:28:46.469
but then they became
more and more frequent.

01:28:56.177 --> 01:28:57.761
Come in.

01:29:01.386 --> 01:29:05.094
But I really need my salary.

01:29:05.261 --> 01:29:06.845
I know.

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.720
And I'd like to help you.

01:29:11.595 --> 01:29:14.845
Have you heard any
of the rumors about yourself?

01:29:18.428 --> 01:29:21.095
They say you see men
every evening

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.970
and spend all night with them.

01:29:27.137 --> 01:29:30.387
They say you can't be trusted,
all of them.

01:29:32.803 --> 01:29:35.012
Why do they say that?

01:29:36.928 --> 01:29:39.553
I suppose they're afraid
that I...

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.220
I can't keep away
from their men.

01:29:45.345 --> 01:29:48.220
Right. And can you?

01:29:49.428 --> 01:29:50.803
No.

01:29:53.928 --> 01:29:56.428
I've spoken with a psychologist.

01:29:57.762 --> 01:29:59.637
He says you're addicted,

01:29:59.803 --> 01:30:02.387
but that it's not the kind of
addiction that can't be treated.

01:30:03.095 --> 01:30:06.095
They have some groups.

01:30:06.262 --> 01:30:08.762
I know about these kinds
of groups.

01:30:08.928 --> 01:30:11.970
I don't have anything
to say to a psychologist.

01:30:12.137 --> 01:30:15.137
I'm not suggesting therapy.
I'm demanding it.

01:30:16.595 --> 01:30:18.720
Even if you leave us,
it'll be the same at your next job

01:30:18.887 --> 01:30:21.345
and the one after that.

01:30:26.303 --> 01:30:28.762
Why didn't you want to speak
with a psychologist?

01:30:30.303 --> 01:30:33.553
It's an old story.
I just don't like them.

01:30:36.887 --> 01:30:38.762
Well, if you insist
that I try to understand,

01:30:38.928 --> 01:30:41.053
then you have
to tell me that story as well.

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.512
The old story.

01:30:44.678 --> 01:30:47.595
Okay. Okay.

01:30:47.762 --> 01:30:50.178
It's not that old after all.

01:30:50.928 --> 01:30:55.428
It was about a year after
I'd lost Marcel and Jerome.

01:31:02.553 --> 01:31:03.928
Okay.

01:31:05.262 --> 01:31:08.012
I'd been careless
with my birth control pills before,

01:31:08.178 --> 01:31:10.720
and now I just didn't use them.

01:31:10.928 --> 01:31:12.887
Didn't the
whole experience with Marcel

01:31:13.053 --> 01:31:15.970
convince you that there was no
room for children in your life?

01:31:16.178 --> 01:31:17.803
That's right.

01:31:22.553 --> 01:31:24.762
I know it sounds
incomprehensible,

01:31:24.928 --> 01:31:27.428
but actually, it was because
of my crippling fear

01:31:27.595 --> 01:31:30.720
of becoming pregnant
that I didn't take the pills.

01:31:30.887 --> 01:31:32.928
It's probably impossible
to understand.

01:31:33.095 --> 01:31:36.678
No, it makes sense to me.

01:31:36.845 --> 01:31:38.970
You were so afraid
of getting pregnant

01:31:39.137 --> 01:31:42.553
that you repressed
the possibility of it.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.970
You couldn't even handle
seeing the box of pills.

01:31:51.553 --> 01:31:53.012
Okay.

01:31:58.428 --> 01:32:00.303
Would you turn it down?

01:32:02.970 --> 01:32:05.595
If you look at the screen
you can see your child,

01:32:05.762 --> 01:32:07.512
but I can't tell you
the gender yet.

01:32:07.678 --> 01:32:10.262
I don't give a shit
about the gender.

01:32:10.428 --> 01:32:11.845
I want it removed.

01:32:14.887 --> 01:32:18.303
Okay. Uh, you're in week eleven.

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:23.012
So legally, there are
no barriers for an abortion.

01:32:23.178 --> 01:32:26.053
Yes, I know that.
Just remove it.

01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:30.553
Well, we have some procedures
to follow.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.345
There's nothing more
to talk about.

01:32:32.512 --> 01:32:34.553
I can have it removed.
I want it removed.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.720
It is a very big decision,
best not made in haste.

01:32:37.887 --> 01:32:40.637
Didn't you understand
what I just said?

01:32:40.803 --> 01:32:43.178
Okay, there's
an informative consultation

01:32:43.345 --> 01:32:46.720
with our psychologist before
you can have the procedure.

01:32:55.678 --> 01:32:58.095
You didn't really fill out the form.

01:32:58.262 --> 01:33:00.178
Maybe you didn't have time,

01:33:00.345 --> 01:33:05.387
uh, so I will need
to ask a few more questions.

01:33:05.553 --> 01:33:09.095
What's the most important thing
in your life right now?

01:33:09.262 --> 01:33:13.345
It could be many things,
your family, your friends, your...

01:33:13.512 --> 01:33:15.637
The most important thing
for me right now

01:33:15.803 --> 01:33:17.928
is to get an abortion.

01:33:19.678 --> 01:33:22.762
Yes. Well, that's what
we're going to resolve together.

01:33:25.137 --> 01:33:27.595
I need some information.

01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.053
Do you love the father?

01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:35.512
That's none of your business.

01:33:35.678 --> 01:33:40.929
Well, it is my business
because I'm here to form

01:33:41.096 --> 01:33:43.846
an impression
of your circumstances.

01:33:44.013 --> 01:33:45.804
That's my job.

01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:47.763
Okay, so what would you
most like me

01:33:47.929 --> 01:33:51.429
to answer about the father in order
to get the fucking abortion?

01:33:51.596 --> 01:33:54.346
That I love him,
or that I don't love him?

01:33:54.513 --> 01:33:59.054
Or that I... I don't know him
because I fuck tons of men?

01:34:04.346 --> 01:34:07.304
I, uh, see that
you were emotional

01:34:07.471 --> 01:34:09.679
during the doctor's examination.

01:34:09.846 --> 01:34:11.971
I think you're emotional.

01:34:12.138 --> 01:34:16.179
Please, listen. This is what we call
an informative consultation.

01:34:16.346 --> 01:34:18.388
What is it I need
to be informed of?

01:34:18.554 --> 01:34:20.596
That you can't
stuff the kid back inside?

01:34:20.763 --> 01:34:23.263
I already know that.

01:34:24.513 --> 01:34:26.638
I just need to be certain

01:34:26.804 --> 01:34:29.013
that you're completely sure
about your choice,

01:34:29.179 --> 01:34:32.346
and my professional opinion
based on your behavior

01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:33.763
is that clearly you're not.

01:34:33.929 --> 01:34:36.096
I've never been more sure
in my life.

01:34:36.263 --> 01:34:38.846
I want that fetus out right now.

01:34:39.013 --> 01:34:42.221
And as a professional, I cannot
defend recommending an abortion

01:34:42.388 --> 01:34:43.471
based on this conversation.

01:34:43.679 --> 01:34:47.679
I've already had a kid!
I know what I want!

01:34:47.846 --> 01:34:49.221
Fuck you.

01:34:55.929 --> 01:34:58.804
There were,
of course, many ways to do it.

01:34:58.971 --> 01:35:01.596
But I had chosen to follow
the common medical procedure

01:35:01.763 --> 01:35:04.554
I had learnt
while studying medicine,

01:35:04.721 --> 01:35:06.846
as it was of great importance
for me

01:35:07.013 --> 01:35:10.346
to get the fetus out straight away
rather than wait for it

01:35:10.513 --> 01:35:13.429
to be expelled
a couple of days later.

01:36:36.554 --> 01:36:39.429
Clearly, the most painful part

01:36:39.596 --> 01:36:42.471
would be the gradual opening
of the cervix,

01:36:42.638 --> 01:36:46.888
which otherwise was always done
under anesthesia.

01:38:50.972 --> 01:38:53.430
wasps, sobs)

01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.347
Say something, Pierrot.

01:39:16.305 --> 01:39:17.389
What do you mean?

01:39:17.555 --> 01:39:20.347
Well, you always have
so many clever things to say.

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.597
Well, I... I feel bad for you

01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:31.639
that you had to cause yourself
so much pain.

01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:42.472
But the... the abortion
is completely understandable.

01:39:42.639 --> 01:39:43.764
You simply thought the child

01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:46.389
wouldn't have
a life worth living, so...

01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:49.014
Yeah, but the abortion in itself.

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.972
Abortion is not murder.
- Oh, come on.

01:39:52.139 --> 01:39:56.055
Don't fall back on false clichÃ©s
just for my sake.

01:39:56.222 --> 01:39:58.930
I ask again,
what about the abortion?

01:39:59.097 --> 01:40:00.222
I have no comment.

01:40:00.389 --> 01:40:03.389
I'm a big proponent
for abortion rights,

01:40:03.555 --> 01:40:06.139
but this is 100% female territory.

01:40:06.305 --> 01:40:08.555
I don't believe a man
can ever comprehend

01:40:08.722 --> 01:40:11.305
the situation or the pain.

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:15.389
And when it comes to the method,
I think the less said, the better.

01:40:15.555 --> 01:40:18.555
Those are two
very interesting points of view.

01:40:18.722 --> 01:40:21.555
First, you say that as a man,

01:40:21.722 --> 01:40:23.847
you can't understand
a woman's feelings

01:40:24.014 --> 01:40:26.514
with regard to abortion.

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.597
Well, that's a bit like saying
that I couldn't understand

01:40:29.764 --> 01:40:32.514
the victims of earthquakes
because they were Chinese.

01:40:34.055 --> 01:40:36.847
I thought we agreed that empathy

01:40:37.014 --> 01:40:39.764
was the foundation
of all humanism.

01:40:39.930 --> 01:40:42.847
But I can see that it's very
convenient for men

01:40:43.014 --> 01:40:46.097
to leave all that abortion
stuff to women.

01:40:46.264 --> 01:40:47.889
That way they don't have
to deal with the guilt

01:40:48.055 --> 01:40:51.014
and all of the small stuff.

01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.764
But your other remark
provokes me even more.

01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:57.222
You think my method
is not worth discussing?

01:40:59.347 --> 01:41:02.930
What enjoyment would I,
or let alone a young pregnant girl,

01:41:03.097 --> 01:41:04.889
have from hearing
all the lurid details

01:41:05.055 --> 01:41:09.139
about how a fetus is removed
in a clinic or any other way?

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.972
Well, then,
we're back at the discussion

01:41:13.139 --> 01:41:15.680
about eating something
that was once alive.

01:41:15.847 --> 01:41:19.722
Do you really think
abortion is so repugnant

01:41:19.889 --> 01:41:21.472
if you believe
that we should know

01:41:21.639 --> 01:41:25.139
how animals are slaughtered
in order to eat them?

01:41:25.305 --> 01:41:27.305
Well, that's a fact
we have to live with,

01:41:27.472 --> 01:41:29.597
even if we try to repress it.

01:41:29.764 --> 01:41:31.180
Just as we do with abortion.

01:41:31.347 --> 01:41:34.180
Well, you sound
like a pro-lifer from Texas.

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:37.514
I don't think so.

01:41:38.305 --> 01:41:41.055
First of all, I'm just
as much a pro-choice as you are.

01:41:41.222 --> 01:41:42.597
But on principle,

01:41:42.764 --> 01:41:46.680
I believe that taboos
are damaging for human beings.

01:41:47.722 --> 01:41:50.514
That's a relatively easy stance
for you to take.

01:41:53.472 --> 01:41:56.555
One that can be misconstrued
as a...

01:41:56.722 --> 01:41:59.555
as an argument
against pregnancy termination.

01:42:01.847 --> 01:42:03.389
I don't want
to belittle anything,

01:42:03.555 --> 01:42:06.972
but I can't see your abortion
as anything but a...

01:42:08.222 --> 01:42:09.847
luxury problem.

01:42:13.264 --> 01:42:15.430
A luxury problem?

01:42:15.597 --> 01:42:18.805
The really serious,
serious abortions,

01:42:18.972 --> 01:42:24.055
the ones that save lives,
far from our social spheres,

01:42:24.222 --> 01:42:25.889
you can't endanger them
just because you

01:42:26.055 --> 01:42:28.722
provocatively insist
on showing the gory details.

01:42:30.055 --> 01:42:33.555
Consider all the millions
of repressed women,

01:42:33.722 --> 01:42:38.264
the victims of rape
and incest, hunger.

01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:41.430
All those who,
maybe thanks to an abortion,

01:42:41.597 --> 01:42:42.640
have regained a new life,

01:42:42.806 --> 01:42:46.640
maybe saved a child
from starving to death.

01:42:46.806 --> 01:42:51.806
You can't harm them just because
of some principle of openness.

01:42:54.973 --> 01:42:59.723
Luckily, I was able to get the head
of the fetus out on the first try,

01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:01.640
but it rarely goes like that.

01:43:01.806 --> 01:43:05.306
In the 12th week,
the diameter of the head

01:43:05.473 --> 01:43:08.473
is a little more than
1.2 centimeters.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.223
Therefore,
a very impressive instrument

01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:13.265
has been developed
by the medical community.

01:43:13.431 --> 01:43:16.140
The nutcracker is an instrument

01:43:16.306 --> 01:43:20.098
that we use to get the fetus
out of the uterus completely.

01:43:20.265 --> 01:43:24.473
We enter it into and through
the dilated cervical channel

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:27.056
and position it around the head
of the fetus,

01:43:27.223 --> 01:43:30.306
and you crack it like a nut,

01:43:30.473 --> 01:43:33.181
and then you pull out the fetus,
and there you have it.

01:43:33.348 --> 01:43:35.931
That is the so-called nutcracker.

01:43:36.098 --> 01:43:38.515
This is not something I need to know.

01:43:39.848 --> 01:43:41.973
Oh, I hope you're not going

01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.015
to be an opponent of abortion
based on that.

01:43:46.181 --> 01:43:49.640
No, but you have to think
of the outrage

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:52.723
this knowledge would create
in society.

01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:56.640
So, you're saying that people
in general are too stupid

01:43:56.806 --> 01:44:00.973
to make decisions
on an informed basis.

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:05.348
And that coming from a man
who only an hour ago sermonized

01:44:05.515 --> 01:44:07.890
about his belief
in human qualities.

01:44:08.056 --> 01:44:10.931
No, you... you're simplifying things.

01:44:11.098 --> 01:44:14.056
You can't look at it like that.

01:44:14.223 --> 01:44:16.640
It's funny to see you
so emotional suddenly.

01:44:21.556 --> 01:44:24.056
Looking back,
it rankles me a bit

01:44:24.223 --> 01:44:28.390
that I didn't just
show up all calm and collected

01:44:28.556 --> 01:44:31.931
at the appointment
with the psychologist

01:44:32.098 --> 01:44:34.681
and have my abortion
under full anesthesia.

01:44:34.848 --> 01:44:38.306
The fact is that when
you're completely under,

01:44:38.473 --> 01:44:41.140
the fetus doesn't feel
anything either,

01:44:41.306 --> 01:44:45.348
whereas my action, of course,
caused pain,

01:44:45.515 --> 01:44:47.390
depending on how much consciousness

01:44:47.556 --> 01:44:52.306
you want to ascribe
to a fetus about 12 weeks old.

01:44:52.473 --> 01:44:55.015
I'm a bit nervous
about bringing that subject up,

01:44:55.181 --> 01:44:57.473
as most of the abortions
in the world,

01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.598
due to lack of resources,

01:44:59.765 --> 01:45:03.890
occur just under
local anesthesia or none.

01:45:05.931 --> 01:45:08.723
Well, you're a careful man.

01:45:09.723 --> 01:45:13.890
Whether we talk about abortion
or not, you can't escape death,

01:45:14.056 --> 01:45:17.973
and my fetus could have turned
out to be a fine human being,

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:21.765
but one that would
also eventually die.

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:27.806
What haunts me
is the ironic detail

01:45:27.973 --> 01:45:30.765
that my father and I
were snail-gatherers.

01:45:34.015 --> 01:45:38.181
We had the deepest compassion,
not to say sentimentality,

01:45:38.348 --> 01:45:41.431
about the smallest living things
on the planet

01:45:41.598 --> 01:45:43.890
which we demonstrated
by saving snails,

01:45:44.056 --> 01:45:47.556
often, by the way,
the same size as my fetus,

01:45:47.681 --> 01:45:50.431
from certain death on the path.

01:45:50.598 --> 01:45:54.056
We did that only
when the other one wasn't watching,

01:45:54.223 --> 01:45:56.390
as it was a bit embarrassing.

01:45:57.765 --> 01:46:00.223
Are you picking up snails?

01:46:01.515 --> 01:46:03.181
No.

01:46:05.056 --> 01:46:06.556
Are you sure you weren't
picking up snails?

01:46:06.723 --> 01:46:08.348
Yeah.
- You're sure?

01:46:08.515 --> 01:46:10.598
Yeah.

01:46:12.973 --> 01:46:16.848
Shall we drop the subject?
- Yes, please.

01:46:17.015 --> 01:46:19.098
Are you sure
you don't want a little tour

01:46:19.265 --> 01:46:21.140
of the technical details

01:46:21.306 --> 01:46:23.973
of removal of organs
for organ donations?

01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.556
No, thank you. I'm fine.

01:46:29.223 --> 01:46:30.181
Where were we?

01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:35.223
I think something about your boss
sending you to see a psychologist.

01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:37.223
Yes, that's right.

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.181
My name is Joe.
- Hi, Joe.

01:46:45.348 --> 01:46:49.348
And I'm a nymphomaniac.
- Sex addict.

01:46:49.515 --> 01:46:52.098
My name is Joe,
and I'm a nymphomaniac.

01:46:52.265 --> 01:46:55.640
We say sex addict.
Here, everyone's the same.

01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:04.681
RenÃ©e, last time you
told us you had a plan.

01:47:04.848 --> 01:47:06.723
How did it go?

01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:10.973
I thought of trying something new,
as nothing had helped.

01:47:12.515 --> 01:47:16.099
I thought if I overdosed...

01:47:16.266 --> 01:47:18.474
in other words,
if I did the exact opposite

01:47:18.641 --> 01:47:20.974
of what we are trying
to do here,

01:47:21.141 --> 01:47:22.557
then I could get well.

01:47:22.724 --> 01:47:25.182
You mean function normally.

01:47:25.349 --> 01:47:28.599
I had prepared
the whole thing very carefully.

01:47:28.766 --> 01:47:31.807
Sent my husband away
for the weekend

01:47:31.974 --> 01:47:35.807
and had the children
taken care of.

01:47:35.974 --> 01:47:37.974
It was to happen on the Saturday.

01:47:40.307 --> 01:47:45.391
I had... I had collected
phone numbers for a whole month,

01:47:45.557 --> 01:47:48.557
and then back in the coal.

01:48:27.474 --> 01:48:30.766
They fucked me for three hours.

01:48:31.057 --> 01:48:34.057
And how did
you feel about that?

01:48:34.224 --> 01:48:37.141
Well, I never feel good afterwards.
I feel ashamed.

01:48:38.224 --> 01:48:40.641
But in relation to...
to your addiction,

01:48:40.807 --> 01:48:43.599
do you feel relieved
like you thought you would?

01:48:46.307 --> 01:48:47.474
No.

01:48:48.974 --> 01:48:52.849
What should I do?
I'm ready to do what's necessary.

01:48:53.016 --> 01:48:55.849
Sex addiction
is very different from,

01:48:56.016 --> 01:48:58.641
say, abuse of drugs or alcohol

01:48:58.807 --> 01:49:01.391
because you don't actually need
either of those things.

01:49:01.557 --> 01:49:03.682
These addictions can
be completely removed

01:49:03.849 --> 01:49:08.307
by removing the drug or the alcohol,
not that that's easy.

01:49:08.474 --> 01:49:11.016
But the difference
with sex addiction

01:49:11.182 --> 01:49:14.266
is that everyone has a sexuality

01:49:14.432 --> 01:49:16.974
that's an integral part
of their personality.

01:49:18.891 --> 01:49:24.057
If one could
imagine exterminating sexuality,

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:26.307
then you'd be left
with a severely reduced person

01:49:26.474 --> 01:49:30.932
because... because sexuality
also includes tenderness,

01:49:31.099 --> 01:49:34.599
contact, solidarity with others,

01:49:34.766 --> 01:49:37.891
which would be hard to imagine
anyone living without on some level.

01:49:39.516 --> 01:49:43.182
What you're saying is that no one
can remove their sexuality,

01:49:43.349 --> 01:49:45.641
even though it's destroying
everything for them.

01:49:45.807 --> 01:49:47.682
I wouldn't say no one,

01:49:47.849 --> 01:49:50.516
but let's say, at most,
one in a million

01:49:50.682 --> 01:49:53.474
manage to live a life
without sexuality.

01:49:53.641 --> 01:49:57.307
But you can't be basing your therapy
on that one in a million.

01:49:57.432 --> 01:50:00.891
No. The first
and most important step

01:50:01.057 --> 01:50:04.807
is to remove incentive
and to reduce exposure.

01:50:06.432 --> 01:50:08.224
You have to ask yourself

01:50:08.391 --> 01:50:11.432
what kind of incentives you have
and then make it difficult

01:50:11.599 --> 01:50:13.349
for yourself to come
into contact with them.

01:50:13.516 --> 01:50:17.391
Basically, anything that
makes you think about sex.

01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:28.017
Stop it.

01:52:32.142 --> 01:52:35.225
Joe has something
she'd like to share.

01:52:36.475 --> 01:52:38.892
My name is Joe.
- Hi, Joe.

01:52:39.058 --> 01:52:40.850
And I'm a sex addict,

01:52:41.017 --> 01:52:45.267
but I haven't had sex
for three weeks and five days.

01:52:48.517 --> 01:52:49.600
Tell us how you did it, Joe.

01:52:49.767 --> 01:52:52.892
You brought notes?
- Yes.

01:52:58.225 --> 01:53:03.267
Dear everyone,
don't think it's been easy,

01:53:03.433 --> 01:53:06.933
but I understand now
that we are all alike.

01:53:21.975 --> 01:53:26.308
Are you okay, Joe?
- Yes, yes.

01:53:30.767 --> 01:53:32.725
Would you like
a glass of water?

01:53:35.433 --> 01:53:37.017
Thank you.

01:53:45.767 --> 01:53:47.892
Would you rather share another time?

01:53:53.683 --> 01:53:56.058
No, I'd like to speak.

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:06.350
Dear everyone,
don't think it's been easy,

01:54:06.517 --> 01:54:08.725
but I understand now

01:54:08.892 --> 01:54:12.892
that we're not
and never will be alike.

01:54:15.142 --> 01:54:19.850
I'm not like you,
who fucks to be validated

01:54:20.017 --> 01:54:22.558
and might just as well give up
putting cocks inside you.

01:54:22.725 --> 01:54:26.392
You already got your bloody kick
a long time ago

01:54:26.558 --> 01:54:29.142
when it turned out that someone
was even bothered to fuck you.

01:54:29.308 --> 01:54:31.183
And I'm not like you.

01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:33.225
Eat yourself to death
if you want.

01:54:33.392 --> 01:54:35.475
I have no pity for you.

01:54:35.642 --> 01:54:37.350
All you want is to be filled up,

01:54:37.517 --> 01:54:42.517
and whether it's by a man
or by tons of disgusting slop

01:54:42.683 --> 01:54:44.600
makes no difference,

01:54:44.767 --> 01:54:46.975
because it's all just
a pathetic attempt

01:54:47.142 --> 01:54:50.017
at filling out
your own resounding emptiness

01:54:50.225 --> 01:54:55.058
and hiding your ridiculous
egocentric self-loathing.

01:54:55.225 --> 01:54:57.725
And I'm definitely not like you.

01:54:57.892 --> 01:55:02.058
That empathy you claim is a lie

01:55:02.225 --> 01:55:06.267
because all you are
is society's morality police,

01:55:06.433 --> 01:55:11.558
whose duty is to erase my obscenity
from the surface of the Earth,

01:55:11.725 --> 01:55:14.558
so that the bourgeoisie
won't feel sick.

01:55:17.767 --> 01:55:19.433
I'm not like you.

01:55:20.642 --> 01:55:25.392
I am a nymphomaniac,
and I love myself for being one,

01:55:25.558 --> 01:55:29.933
but above all, I love my cunt

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:33.225
and my filthy, dirty lust.

01:55:56.558 --> 01:55:58.683
What just happened?

01:55:58.850 --> 01:56:02.892
I didn't get that,
with the car that burned.

01:56:03.058 --> 01:56:04.642
No, I'm sorry.

01:56:04.808 --> 01:56:08.433
I was just in too much of
a hurry to get to the last chapter.

01:56:18.476 --> 01:56:20.476
It's dawning.

01:56:20.643 --> 01:56:23.268
How can you tell?

01:56:23.434 --> 01:56:26.184
Oh, it's...
it's just a slight coloring.

01:56:26.351 --> 01:56:29.768
I know because I've stood here
so often at this time.

01:56:31.143 --> 01:56:33.476
You could say
I've developed an ability

01:56:33.643 --> 01:56:37.434
to see dawn before everyone else.

01:56:41.101 --> 01:56:43.934
Then you understand
what I mean when I say

01:56:44.101 --> 01:56:48.351
that twilight suddenly appeared
at this point in my story.

01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:53.726
I understood that society
had no room for me,

01:56:53.893 --> 01:56:58.434
and I had no room for society
and never had.

01:57:00.184 --> 01:57:02.476
It would've been much, much easier

01:57:02.643 --> 01:57:04.893
to have realized that earlier on,

01:57:05.059 --> 01:57:08.226
but suddenly,

01:57:08.393 --> 01:57:11.143
my senses unfolded dramatically.

01:57:12.976 --> 01:57:16.976
To go from the respectable
daylight side of society

01:57:17.143 --> 01:57:19.518
to the shady, nocturnal side

01:57:20.393 --> 01:57:22.601
was like changing sides in a war.

01:57:23.684 --> 01:57:26.143
You put your old army behind you,

01:57:26.309 --> 01:57:29.684
and suddenly, the next second,
you're swallowed by the new one.

01:57:29.851 --> 01:57:32.226
There's no in between.

01:57:46.309 --> 01:57:48.309
I'm sure it was quite natural for you

01:57:48.476 --> 01:57:50.809
to furnish your room
as a monk's cell,

01:57:50.976 --> 01:57:55.476
but as an inspiration
for this story, chapter headings

01:57:55.643 --> 01:57:57.768
hasn't been easy.

01:57:57.934 --> 01:58:01.018
There's simply nothing
left for me to use.

01:58:02.601 --> 01:58:04.601
Well, I'm sorry about that.

01:58:05.934 --> 01:58:08.476
But if I may,
I can give you a tip.

01:58:09.851 --> 01:58:11.726
Yes, please.

01:58:11.893 --> 01:58:14.601
You know, I occupy myself
mostly with texts,

01:58:14.768 --> 01:58:18.101
but sometimes the text can seem so...

01:58:18.268 --> 01:58:22.143
so empty, so unfathomably empty.

01:58:22.309 --> 01:58:26.268
It could be the best text
by the most famous author.

01:58:26.434 --> 01:58:30.059
The solution might be
to change your point of view.

01:58:31.768 --> 01:58:33.726
I don't get that.

01:58:33.893 --> 01:58:39.059
Things hide
when they become familiar.

01:58:39.226 --> 01:58:43.226
But if you look at them
from another angle,

01:58:43.393 --> 01:58:46.184
they might take
on a new meaning.

01:58:57.309 --> 01:58:58.601
You're right.

01:58:59.726 --> 01:59:04.351
Before this was just the stain
from the tea I threw.

01:59:05.809 --> 01:59:08.476
Can you see what it could be?

01:59:09.934 --> 01:59:11.268
A revolver!

01:59:11.434 --> 01:59:14.976
No, a revolver has a drum
that revolves.

01:59:15.143 --> 01:59:17.143
It's a pistol.

01:59:17.309 --> 01:59:20.018
Can you see what kind it could be?

01:59:20.184 --> 01:59:23.309
No, I don't remember anything
like that from my literature.

01:59:23.476 --> 01:59:25.893
Oh, but it's something
I can remember from mine.

01:59:26.059 --> 01:59:30.351
Ian Fleming.
- Not familiar.

01:59:30.518 --> 01:59:33.768
If you haven't read that,
you haven't read anything at all.

01:59:35.143 --> 01:59:38.143
This could be,
with a little imagination,

01:59:38.309 --> 01:59:41.934
a Walther PPK automatic,

01:59:42.101 --> 01:59:44.351
the same gun
that was issued to Bond,

01:59:44.518 --> 01:59:47.934
after his preferred pistol,
the Beretta, had jammed.

01:59:49.726 --> 01:59:51.143
Is that something you can use?

01:59:53.101 --> 01:59:55.018
Oh, yes, it is.

02:00:04.643 --> 02:00:09.143
Whether I left
society or it left me, I cannot say.

02:00:09.309 --> 02:00:12.434
I suppose you could make
an argument for both sides.

02:00:13.893 --> 02:00:15.893
I was on my way
to the shady side

02:00:16.059 --> 02:00:19.434
of the debt collecting business,
which, among other things,

02:00:19.601 --> 02:00:22.726
involves stuff like
burning people's cars.

02:00:24.768 --> 02:00:28.684
I had for a long time
known about this man, L.

02:00:33.976 --> 02:00:36.184
Hi, my name is Joe.

02:00:36.351 --> 02:00:40.268
I know that. Come in.

02:00:44.893 --> 02:00:46.851
I'm looking for a job.

02:00:48.394 --> 02:00:49.810
I've been working in an office,

02:00:49.977 --> 02:00:52.477
and I was never really good at it.

02:00:52.644 --> 02:00:56.269
I can understand that.
I mean, what's the point?

02:00:58.935 --> 02:01:02.727
I've thought of you now and then
and wondered when you'd show up.

02:01:06.394 --> 02:01:10.394
My lifestyle is relatively expensive,

02:01:12.227 --> 02:01:15.685
and I need a fair amount
of free time for a sideline.

02:01:15.852 --> 02:01:17.769
Of course.
I already know that.

02:01:17.935 --> 02:01:20.810
I believe I possess
some qualifications

02:01:20.977 --> 02:01:23.227
and that I'm rather unscrupulous.

02:01:23.394 --> 02:01:26.977
I know all about your qualifications
and they're excellent.

02:01:27.144 --> 02:01:30.769
And you have already proven you
are unscrupulous by coming here.

02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:37.810
I would suggest that you start
your own little business

02:01:37.977 --> 02:01:39.852
with my help.

02:01:40.019 --> 02:01:44.019
I understand you possess
a great deal of insight

02:01:44.185 --> 02:01:47.060
about a rather broad spectrum of men.

02:01:48.394 --> 02:01:52.477
This could be, or should be,
capitalized on.

02:01:52.644 --> 02:01:55.144
What should I do?

02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:58.269
I facilitate certain assignments
for my humble firm

02:01:58.435 --> 02:02:00.519
as part of a debt
collection business.

02:02:00.685 --> 02:02:03.185
In other words,
I need subcontractors

02:02:03.352 --> 02:02:06.060
who can put moderate pressure
on individuals,

02:02:06.227 --> 02:02:10.144
with whom my clients rightly
or wrongly have a bone to pick.

02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:12.769
Understand?
- Extortion.

02:02:12.935 --> 02:02:14.727
No. No, no, no, no.

02:02:14.894 --> 02:02:19.644
I always prefer
the term 'debt collection.'

02:02:21.352 --> 02:02:23.019
Yeah.
- I refrain from judging

02:02:23.185 --> 02:02:27.435
whether my clients' wishes
are legitimate or otherwise,

02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:31.894
a point of view I strongly
recommend you follow.

02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:38.727
I'm still unsure of what it is
I should do.

02:02:38.894 --> 02:02:40.977
Well, you'll need two thugs,

02:02:41.144 --> 02:02:43.685
and I can think of two good ones.

02:02:43.852 --> 02:02:48.394
They both have a lot of experience
and can show you the ropes.

02:02:49.519 --> 02:02:51.394
That's interesting.

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.560
It's not at all interesting.

02:02:54.727 --> 02:02:56.977
Most interesting thing about it was

02:02:57.144 --> 02:03:00.019
how easily I dedicated
myself to crime.

02:03:00.185 --> 02:03:02.394
My main
qualification, of course,

02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:05.644
was my considerable experience
with men and sex.

02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:09.852
But even my more specialized
skills came in handy.

02:03:31.519 --> 02:03:35.394
No, now this is not how it goes.

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.894
You have to wait until you're hit.

02:03:40.602 --> 02:03:44.310
The two helpers that
L had recommended were okay,

02:03:44.477 --> 02:03:47.977
but they were predisposed
to a rather repetitive technique,

02:03:48.144 --> 02:03:51.935
which consisted of creating
as much havoc as possible

02:03:52.102 --> 02:03:53.519
with a pair of iron bars.

02:04:09.185 --> 02:04:13.519
Destroying your things doesn't
seem to have much effect on you.

02:04:13.685 --> 02:04:15.144
The only thing
worth mentioning

02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:17.519
from my first years
as a collector

02:04:17.685 --> 02:04:21.435
was the story of an unusually
sober-minded,

02:04:21.602 --> 02:04:24.394
and for that reason vulnerable, man.

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.435
The dirt I threatened
to go public with

02:04:27.602 --> 02:04:31.102
was normally within
my core competence: sex.

02:04:31.977 --> 02:04:36.602
But for once, here was a man
I was unable to read sexually,

02:04:36.769 --> 02:04:39.394
so I became persistent.

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:41.394
Tie him to the chair.

02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:44.727
Don't hurt him.

02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:50.310
I can't find a stain on you,

02:04:51.185 --> 02:04:54.144
but my experience tells me
that no man is spotless.

02:04:55.352 --> 02:04:59.352
Luckily, you're equipped with
a very reliable truth detector.

02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:12.810
I'm going to tell you a few stories.

02:05:12.977 --> 02:05:15.352
All you have to do is listen.

02:05:17.394 --> 02:05:20.520
You're in a bar watching a couple...

02:05:20.686 --> 02:05:23.228
I now meticulously
went through the catalogue

02:05:23.395 --> 02:05:26.603
of sexual deviations
in fictional form.

02:05:26.770 --> 02:05:29.686
Stories about sado-masochism,

02:05:29.853 --> 02:05:33.978
fetishism, homosexuality,
you name it.

02:05:34.145 --> 02:05:35.853
But he didn't react.

02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:38.478
And I'd almost given up
when I said...

02:05:38.645 --> 02:05:43.270
On your way home,
you walk through the park.

02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:49.728
And something makes you stop.

02:05:50.853 --> 02:05:52.686
You hear something.

02:06:06.895 --> 02:06:08.603
Yes, that's it.

02:06:08.770 --> 02:06:12.478
You can hear the children
in the playground.

02:06:13.603 --> 02:06:18.061
You sit on a bench nearby
and watch them play.

02:06:18.228 --> 02:06:21.395
There's a little boy in shorts.

02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:24.978
He's playing in the sandpit.

02:06:26.978 --> 02:06:31.853
He looks at you
with his blue eyes.

02:06:33.395 --> 02:06:35.103
He smiles at you.

02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:37.436
I think he comes to you.

02:06:37.645 --> 02:06:42.770
He sits on your lap
and looks up at your face.

02:06:43.436 --> 02:06:47.686
He says he'd like
to come home with you.

02:06:51.853 --> 02:06:53.103
At home,

02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:56.561
you can't fight the idea
of being naked together.

02:06:57.561 --> 02:07:00.020
He crawls all over you.

02:07:00.186 --> 02:07:01.811
You get an erection.

02:07:01.978 --> 02:07:04.061
Won't you please stop?

02:07:04.228 --> 02:07:06.978
He lies on his stomach.

02:07:07.770 --> 02:07:10.603
You pull down his pants.

02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:12.395
I'll pay!

02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:47.020
You did what?

02:07:47.186 --> 02:07:48.936
I gave him a blowjob.

02:07:49.103 --> 02:07:52.770
Why? That pig!
- I took pity on him.

02:07:52.936 --> 02:07:54.270
Pity?

02:07:54.436 --> 02:07:57.936
Yes. I had just destroyed his life.

02:07:58.103 --> 02:08:02.270
Nobody knew his secret,
most probably not even himself.

02:08:03.478 --> 02:08:06.061
He sat there with the shame.

02:08:06.228 --> 02:08:09.478
I suppose I sucked him off
as a kind of apology.

02:08:09.645 --> 02:08:10.686
That's unbelievable.

02:08:11.978 --> 02:08:14.853
No, listen to me.
This is a man who'd succeeded

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:16.978
in repressing his own desire,

02:08:17.145 --> 02:08:22.270
who had never before given into it,
right up until I forced it out.

02:08:22.436 --> 02:08:24.936
He had lived a life full of denial

02:08:25.103 --> 02:08:27.520
and had never hurt a soul.

02:08:27.686 --> 02:08:30.520
I think that's laudable.

02:08:30.686 --> 02:08:31.728
No matter how much I try,

02:08:31.895 --> 02:08:34.478
I can't find anything laudable
in pedophilia.

02:08:34.645 --> 02:08:37.520
That's because you think
about the perhaps five percent

02:08:37.686 --> 02:08:40.103
who actually hurt children.

02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:45.020
The remaining 95 percent
never live out their fantasies.

02:08:45.186 --> 02:08:47.603
Think about their suffering.

02:08:47.770 --> 02:08:52.686
Sexuality is the strongest force
in human beings.

02:08:52.853 --> 02:08:57.686
To be born with a forbidden
sexuality must be agonizing.

02:08:57.853 --> 02:09:01.270
The pedophile
who manages to get through life

02:09:01.436 --> 02:09:03.520
with the shame of his desire

02:09:03.686 --> 02:09:07.478
while never acting on it,
deserves a bloody medal.

02:09:14.561 --> 02:09:18.186
The writer Thomas Mann
said somewhere

02:09:18.353 --> 02:09:20.436
that a temptation resisted

02:09:20.603 --> 02:09:24.895
is not a sin
but a test of virtue.

02:09:28.645 --> 02:09:32.270
Wasn't there something
about that writer and boys?

02:09:32.436 --> 02:09:35.020
Yeah, so they say.

02:09:35.186 --> 02:09:38.353
I suppose he dealt with it
by writing them out.

02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:41.270
And he got a medal, a Nobel Prize.

02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:48.895
But there was
another reason for my sympathy,

02:09:49.061 --> 02:09:51.396
which you find so mysterious.

02:09:53.271 --> 02:09:57.271
I saw a man who was carrying
the same cross as myself.

02:09:59.896 --> 02:10:01.979
Loneliness.

02:10:05.187 --> 02:10:07.979
We were both sexual outcasts.

02:10:16.479 --> 02:10:18.479
In any case,
some years passed,

02:10:18.646 --> 02:10:21.604
during which my business grew,

02:10:21.771 --> 02:10:26.354
enabling me to step up my
anonymous deposits to Marcel.

02:10:27.271 --> 02:10:30.812
Your business is doing great.

02:10:30.979 --> 02:10:34.771
You complete all the jobs
I give you to perfection.

02:10:34.937 --> 02:10:39.604
And I hear only words of praise
from your other clients, but...

02:10:39.771 --> 02:10:42.687
But what?
- We aren't getting any younger.

02:10:42.854 --> 02:10:46.854
No, that's for sure.

02:10:47.021 --> 02:10:48.479
I think you're getting to that age

02:10:48.646 --> 02:10:50.646
where you have to start thinking
about a successor.

02:10:50.812 --> 02:10:54.521
Oh, I don't need a fucking successor.

02:10:54.687 --> 02:10:56.354
Listen.

02:10:56.521 --> 02:10:59.896
A person should take
their crime seriously.

02:11:00.062 --> 02:11:03.187
You need someone
to be your right hand,

02:11:03.354 --> 02:11:07.187
someone to help you.
A crown princess.

02:11:09.479 --> 02:11:12.729
The normal process is to find out

02:11:12.896 --> 02:11:16.354
what colleagues are in prison,
or are drug addicts,

02:11:16.521 --> 02:11:21.187
and thereby unable to fulfill
their roles as parents.

02:11:21.354 --> 02:11:25.687
Then, you find out
where their kids play football,

02:11:25.854 --> 02:11:28.146
and you get involved.

02:11:28.312 --> 02:11:30.062
You cheer them on
for a couple of years,

02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:33.687
no matter how bad they are.
Actually, the worse, the better.

02:11:33.854 --> 02:11:37.812
That way, gradually, you take on
the role of the parent

02:11:37.979 --> 02:11:41.729
until, in the end,
you have a loyal helper

02:11:41.896 --> 02:11:45.187
that will walk through fire for you.

02:11:45.354 --> 02:11:47.396
Even do time for you.

02:11:51.146 --> 02:11:55.271
It sounds like a kind of
an entrapment you're suggesting.

02:11:55.437 --> 02:11:58.896
An unsavory entrapment.
- Call it what you want,

02:11:59.062 --> 02:12:03.021
but if you believe at all in
the effects of good parenting,

02:12:03.187 --> 02:12:06.104
that kid will have much greater
opportunities with you

02:12:06.271 --> 02:12:08.687
as a mentor than without.

02:12:08.854 --> 02:12:11.229
And since I like you,

02:12:11.396 --> 02:12:15.229
I've been looking around
for a suitable subject.

02:12:15.396 --> 02:12:20.687
She's 15 years old from
a family of hardened criminals,

02:12:20.854 --> 02:12:23.187
and she's been through a lot.

02:12:23.354 --> 02:12:26.437
Last couple of years
she's been institutionalized.

02:12:26.604 --> 02:12:29.146
Her father's in prison
and her mother died of an overdose.

02:12:29.312 --> 02:12:31.021
She's a smart girl.

02:12:31.187 --> 02:12:33.104
And although
she doesn't play football,

02:12:33.271 --> 02:12:36.062
she does play basketball very badly.

02:12:37.312 --> 02:12:42.687
She's chosen a team sport
because she's lonely.

02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:45.854
I saved the best part for last.

02:12:46.021 --> 02:12:48.979
Her right ear is slightly deformed,

02:12:49.146 --> 02:12:52.854
which she is very ashamed of,

02:12:53.021 --> 02:12:56.021
and of course, this serves
to isolate her even more.

02:12:56.187 --> 02:13:00.521
It makes her an easy target
for even the slightest bit

02:13:00.687 --> 02:13:05.437
of attention
or sign of empathy from you.

02:13:09.396 --> 02:13:12.979
Despite my protests,
the clever L somehow talked me

02:13:13.146 --> 02:13:14.771
into actually having a look at P.

02:13:17.562 --> 02:13:20.937
The longer I watched the poor girl
with the deformed ear,

02:13:21.104 --> 02:13:24.312
the more repulsive
I found the whole plan.

02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:53.229
But as if L had foreseen this,

02:13:53.396 --> 02:13:59.062
the meeting with P filled me
with pity and emotion.

02:13:59.229 --> 02:14:00.937
And without wanting to,

02:14:01.104 --> 02:14:04.354
I found myself,
weekend after weekend,

02:14:04.521 --> 02:14:08.229
at her games
supporting the poor player.

02:14:23.272 --> 02:14:26.813
Thanks for cheering me on.
- You're welcome.

02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:29.230
You played really well today.

02:14:31.647 --> 02:14:34.313
No, I didn't.
- You did.

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:37.522
You really improved yourself lately.

02:14:49.022 --> 02:14:52.772
Sixteen years. Congratulations.

02:14:52.938 --> 02:14:55.730
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:20.022
I was proud to introduce P

02:15:20.188 --> 02:15:22.855
to my father's passion
and his world.

02:15:25.938 --> 02:15:27.730
It's actually...

02:15:29.188 --> 02:15:33.147
the souls of the trees
that we see in the winter.

02:15:39.563 --> 02:15:42.188
I think they look like human souls.

02:15:46.272 --> 02:15:48.147
Yeah, you're right.

02:15:49.022 --> 02:15:51.772
They do look like human souls.

02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:55.188
Twisted souls, regular souls,

02:15:55.355 --> 02:15:57.438
crazy souls,

02:15:57.605 --> 02:16:01.272
all depending on the kind
of lives human beings lead.

02:16:04.147 --> 02:16:08.563
Then that must be
Miss Williamson from number 21.

02:16:08.730 --> 02:16:11.230
That's not a very nice thing
to say about Miss Williamson.

02:16:11.397 --> 02:16:14.938
But she's always angry.
She has a monster in her belly.

02:16:15.105 --> 02:16:17.647
Well, she does have
an ulcer in her belly

02:16:17.813 --> 02:16:19.480
that I've been treating
for the last 15 years.

02:16:22.063 --> 02:16:24.480
And sure enough,
one of the following days

02:16:24.647 --> 02:16:26.897
my dad dragged me
into the woods again.

02:16:27.063 --> 02:16:30.855
I found my tree.
My soul tree.

02:16:33.188 --> 02:16:38.938
And no, it's not that one, okay,
'cause then I would be dead.

02:16:40.855 --> 02:16:43.063
This is my tree.

02:16:46.438 --> 02:16:50.563
It's not an ash tree.
- No, it's an oak tree.

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:55.647
It has two trunks.

02:16:55.813 --> 02:16:59.022
Yeah, isn't it great?

02:16:59.188 --> 02:17:04.397
It shows itself to both sides,
the lake and the forest.

02:17:14.397 --> 02:17:18.688
But, Dad, how does
a tree get two trunks?

02:17:20.313 --> 02:17:24.272
The most common reason
is that the top broke

02:17:24.438 --> 02:17:26.313
when it was very young.

02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:30.313
That means
that you've been broken once.

02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:32.522
Have you, Dad?

02:17:38.730 --> 02:17:41.938
It seems that it can be
rather revealing...

02:17:43.397 --> 02:17:45.688
to find your soul tree.

02:17:49.688 --> 02:17:55.313
My father found his soul tree,
but I've never found mine.

02:17:55.855 --> 02:18:01.022
'You will know it when you see it,'
is what he said.

02:18:07.605 --> 02:18:13.438
Kitchen and dining room.
And in here...

02:18:15.272 --> 02:18:17.605
When P reached the age of maturity

02:18:17.772 --> 02:18:20.063
and I became her personal adviser,

02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:22.730
I asked her to move in with me.

02:18:31.147 --> 02:18:33.897
Let me see you with your hair up.

02:18:34.063 --> 02:18:36.563
You're so pretty.

02:18:48.605 --> 02:18:52.313
All this time
all my sexual activity had stopped.

02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:57.022
My groin was one big sore
from my abuse that wouldn't heal,

02:18:57.189 --> 02:19:00.022
and made even
masturbation impossible.

02:19:04.272 --> 02:19:07.564
I experienced definite
abstinence symptoms...

02:19:07.731 --> 02:19:09.689
fever and cramps.

02:19:34.647 --> 02:19:36.397
Joe, what's going on?

02:19:38.606 --> 02:19:41.397
Careful.
- We need to clear this up.

02:19:50.273 --> 02:19:53.231
I just get this sometimes.

02:19:56.564 --> 02:19:59.064
It's okay. It's okay.

02:20:03.148 --> 02:20:05.648
Do you want to go back to bed?

02:20:07.648 --> 02:20:09.856
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:20:25.981 --> 02:20:27.856
I love you, Joe.

02:20:28.023 --> 02:20:29.773
I love you, too.

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:33.523
I don't mean it in that way.

02:20:36.564 --> 02:20:39.981
Come on, it's late.
You should go back to bed.

02:20:41.523 --> 02:20:42.564
Good night.

02:20:45.439 --> 02:20:47.856
Perhaps she really loved you.

02:20:51.939 --> 02:20:55.314
She was so very young.

02:20:55.481 --> 02:20:59.773
Maybe she, too, discovered
her cunt at the age of two.

02:20:59.939 --> 02:21:02.064
Maybe earlier.

02:21:02.231 --> 02:21:03.773
I couldn't accept it.

02:21:03.939 --> 02:21:07.731
Perhaps because you
really wanted it to be true.

02:21:09.814 --> 02:21:11.481
Perhaps I hoped it.

02:21:11.648 --> 02:21:14.981
It's very touching,
all this about P.

02:21:17.189 --> 02:21:20.773
Then you've probably
misunderstood the whole thing.

02:21:20.939 --> 02:21:24.439
Shall we get the story over
and done with?

02:21:52.564 --> 02:21:54.606
Don't.

02:21:55.814 --> 02:21:57.898
I wanna see you.

02:21:58.064 --> 02:21:59.064
Don't.
- Why?

02:21:59.231 --> 02:22:00.689
Please, don't.
- Why not?

02:22:00.856 --> 02:22:04.398
No. No, I have a wound.

02:22:04.564 --> 02:22:06.564
I have a wound.
- It doesn't matter.

02:22:06.731 --> 02:22:10.606
No, you don't understand.
- I have that thing with my ear.

02:22:10.773 --> 02:22:13.439
I'm so ashamed.

02:22:49.773 --> 02:22:51.856
Do you like me?

02:22:55.439 --> 02:22:57.439
You're so beautiful.

02:24:35.024 --> 02:24:37.774
There's one thing
I don't understand.

02:24:38.607 --> 02:24:41.315
Did she know what you did
for a living?

02:24:41.482 --> 02:24:46.649
P was very discreet
and a girl of few words.

02:24:48.149 --> 02:24:50.440
Oddly, although I worked
strange hours,

02:24:50.607 --> 02:24:52.482
she never asked about my work.

02:24:54.232 --> 02:24:57.065
But one day she had a question.

02:24:58.690 --> 02:25:00.315
Joe.

02:25:05.357 --> 02:25:09.190
Why did you start
coming to my basketball matches?

02:25:11.274 --> 02:25:13.940
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

02:25:19.524 --> 02:25:22.482
No, it wasn't a coincidence.

02:25:26.274 --> 02:25:28.940
I didn't tell you because I...

02:25:29.107 --> 02:25:32.107
I thought you'd be upset...

02:25:33.482 --> 02:25:36.357
and that you'd get angry at me.

02:25:36.524 --> 02:25:39.024
I won't get angry-

02:25:43.565 --> 02:25:45.690
What I do...

02:25:47.232 --> 02:25:49.899
My job isn't a normal job.

02:25:50.065 --> 02:25:52.190
It's not legal.

02:25:52.357 --> 02:25:55.232
No one in my family
does anything legal.

02:26:00.899 --> 02:26:05.315
A man that's helped me in my business
suggested that I watched you.

02:26:08.232 --> 02:26:12.524
The plan was that I...
I should look at you

02:26:12.690 --> 02:26:16.982
to see whether one day I could
use you in my work.

02:26:17.149 --> 02:26:20.107
I should make friends with you

02:26:20.274 --> 02:26:23.482
because I knew you didn't
have a mother or a father.

02:26:23.649 --> 02:26:25.482
What's wrong with that?

02:26:25.649 --> 02:26:29.232
Don't you see
how evil that plan was?

02:26:29.399 --> 02:26:33.107
I felt terrible.
- You shouldn't have.

02:26:33.274 --> 02:26:35.232
Why not?

02:26:38.024 --> 02:26:40.440
Because if you hadn't...

02:26:42.399 --> 02:26:44.649
we'd never have met.

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.649
I'd like to go with you
to work next time.

02:26:53.815 --> 02:26:55.232
No.

02:27:04.274 --> 02:27:05.815
Will you think about it?

02:27:05.982 --> 02:27:07.357
No.
- Yes.

02:27:07.524 --> 02:27:08.565
No.
- Yes.

02:27:08.982 --> 02:27:11.899
She didn't take no
for an answer.

02:27:12.065 --> 02:27:14.315
No, of course not.

02:27:14.482 --> 02:27:17.899
How do you keep a wave
upon the sand?

02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:25.690
And in the throes of love,
I was weak and no match for her.

02:27:28.774 --> 02:27:32.399
With the risk
of being too clever for myself,

02:27:32.565 --> 02:27:37.024
social inheritance
is an irrefutable fact.

02:27:38.399 --> 02:27:42.649
If anyone knew about the laws
of the street, it must've been P.

02:27:43.857 --> 02:27:47.565
You're more right than you know.

02:28:07.608 --> 02:28:10.025
Let's shoot the fucker.
- No, no!

02:28:10.191 --> 02:28:13.316
Stop! Stop!

02:28:16.691 --> 02:28:19.066
We don't use firearms.

02:28:20.233 --> 02:28:24.025
I'd like to have the gun.
- The others have weapons, too.

02:28:25.483 --> 02:28:27.025
Well, I didn't know that,

02:28:27.191 --> 02:28:29.108
but in any case,
you're not to have one.

02:28:30.233 --> 02:28:31.900
But guns aren't dangerous.

02:28:32.066 --> 02:28:34.483
It depends on how you use them.

02:28:34.650 --> 02:28:36.108
Yes, exactly.

02:28:36.275 --> 02:28:37.775
I wasn't going to shoot him.

02:28:38.816 --> 02:28:40.983
We wouldn't have gotten
any money out of him that way.

02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:43.025
Can I have the gun?

02:28:47.650 --> 02:28:49.358
Thank you.

02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:10.941
You're evil.

02:29:14.941 --> 02:29:19.025
And now I'm afraid
one of those coincidences

02:29:19.191 --> 02:29:24.358
you have such a hard time with
occurred with a very special person.

02:29:25.608 --> 02:29:28.275
It was P's job to take us
to the debtors,

02:29:28.441 --> 02:29:30.566
so until I saw the name
on the door,

02:29:30.691 --> 02:29:33.066
I had no idea
whose house we were at.

02:29:35.441 --> 02:29:39.900
This is Acer siccharium.

02:29:40.066 --> 02:29:42.483
Saccharinum.
- Saccharinum, yeah, that.

02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:43.816
I said that.

02:29:52.941 --> 02:29:54.775
Are you sure
this is the right place?

02:29:54.941 --> 02:29:55.691
Yeah.

02:30:02.775 --> 02:30:08.441
I was thinking maybe it's time for
you to do this one on your own.

02:30:09.358 --> 02:30:10.650
Yeah?

02:30:12.566 --> 02:30:15.566
Thank you, Joe.
- I don't want anything destroyed,

02:30:16.525 --> 02:30:18.816
and I don't want anybody hurt.

02:30:18.983 --> 02:30:24.233
Okay? You just show yourself and
offer him a reasonable payment plan.

02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:29.025
If you say so, of course
that's how I'll do it.

02:30:44.275 --> 02:30:46.858
Whether the feeling
when I saw Jerome again was love,

02:30:47.025 --> 02:30:48.650
I couldn't say.

02:30:51.608 --> 02:30:54.191
But it was a feeling...

02:30:54.358 --> 02:30:57.066
and far stronger than I liked.

02:31:08.275 --> 02:31:12.191
I was actually
walking home through the alley here.

02:31:12.358 --> 02:31:14.650
Your two neighborhoods
are totally different,

02:31:14.816 --> 02:31:18.191
but still so close together
that the shortest route

02:31:18.358 --> 02:31:22.358
from Jerome's house towards
the center was through the alley.

02:31:29.316 --> 02:31:31.316
Hello!

02:31:31.483 --> 02:31:35.358
How did it go?
- Brilliant.

02:31:35.566 --> 02:31:38.650
Yeah, really well.

02:31:38.816 --> 02:31:41.400
I made a reasonable payment plan
like you told me to.

02:31:41.566 --> 02:31:46.441
How did he look?
- Scared.

02:31:46.608 --> 02:31:48.983
How old did he look?

02:31:49.150 --> 02:31:52.483
I don't know. Ancient?

02:32:12.316 --> 02:32:16.066
Jerome was to pay
off his debt in six payments.

02:32:16.233 --> 02:32:18.983
Every time P
went to Jerome to collect,

02:32:19.150 --> 02:32:23.900
I'd pace around restlessly
until she was back home again.

02:32:26.191 --> 02:32:29.484
I even had to find my mother's
sad old solitaire cards

02:32:29.651 --> 02:32:32.692
in order to make the hours pass.

02:32:40.109 --> 02:32:41.984
Each night I was less reassured

02:32:42.151 --> 02:32:45.192
by her coming home
than the night before.

02:32:45.359 --> 02:32:48.609
The question of whether jealousy is
the fear of sharing

02:32:48.776 --> 02:32:52.067
or the fear of losing
was of little interest to me.

02:32:52.234 --> 02:32:55.359
But yes, it was a fact
that this unworthy feeling

02:32:55.526 --> 02:33:00.234
I had managed to suppress
for so long was creeping up on me.

02:33:03.067 --> 02:33:05.817
The evening she was
to collect the final payment,

02:33:05.984 --> 02:33:07.817
she didn't kiss me.

02:33:07.984 --> 02:33:10.317
I took it to be forgetfulness,

02:33:10.484 --> 02:33:14.401
but the hours passed,
and she didn't return.

02:33:21.484 --> 02:33:26.692
Every time I saw car lights,
I thought it was P being driven home.

02:34:25.234 --> 02:34:27.317
So the next morning I took a trip

02:34:27.484 --> 02:34:30.651
to the round hills
just outside of town

02:34:30.817 --> 02:34:34.192
that I visited with my school class
when I was 12,

02:34:34.359 --> 02:34:37.817
to say a symbolic goodbye.

02:34:41.442 --> 02:34:44.151
I had decided to flee.

02:34:44.317 --> 02:34:48.817
I couldn't stay in this town
with her and him.

02:34:48.984 --> 02:34:53.276
I had cowardly made a plan
to escape and head south.

02:34:53.442 --> 02:34:54.776
Like from some ice age

02:34:54.942 --> 02:34:58.109
I didn't have the guts
to turn around and face.

02:34:59.276 --> 02:35:03.484
But the goodbye was sad
and strangely unfulfilling.

02:35:03.651 --> 02:35:07.609
And something called me on to
seek further up the mountain.

02:36:31.151 --> 02:36:33.734
I understand dictators
who commit murder.

02:36:36.692 --> 02:36:39.567
What was Hitler,
when it all boils down,

02:36:39.734 --> 02:36:43.734
other than a man to whom society
gave free reins?

02:36:46.276 --> 02:36:49.567
Well, that was
just what we were missing.

02:36:49.734 --> 02:36:53.567
You understand racists,
you have a soft spot for pedophiles,

02:36:53.734 --> 02:36:56.651
and, of course,
now at the finishing line,

02:36:56.817 --> 02:36:58.567
you have to sympathize

02:36:58.734 --> 02:37:01.360
with the greatest mass
murderers of history.

02:37:01.527 --> 02:37:03.777
What I mean is...

02:37:05.443 --> 02:37:07.985
It's said to be difficult
to take someone's life.

02:37:08.193 --> 02:37:12.027
I would've said
that it's more difficult not to

02:37:12.193 --> 02:37:15.985
when, as a dictator or as me,

02:37:16.152 --> 02:37:18.527
you've nothing to lose.

02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:22.110
For a human being,

02:37:22.277 --> 02:37:25.485
killing is the most
natural thing in the world.

02:37:25.652 --> 02:37:27.902
We're created for it.

02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:32.027
Wonderful.

02:38:22.735 --> 02:38:24.277
No, get off!

02:38:34.485 --> 02:38:36.652
Fireman's grip.

02:42:22.653 --> 02:42:27.194
Fill all my holes, please.

02:42:51.861 --> 02:42:54.611
I still don't know
why the gun didn't work.

02:42:54.778 --> 02:42:59.278
I did check to make sure that there
were bullets in the magazine.

02:42:59.444 --> 02:43:02.111
It simply malfunctioned.

02:43:02.278 --> 02:43:04.861
Just like Bond's Beretta.

02:43:05.028 --> 02:43:08.111
I think I know enough to say
that even if you had rounds

02:43:08.278 --> 02:43:10.278
in the magazine
of the Walther PPK,

02:43:10.444 --> 02:43:13.944
if you'd taken off the safety,

02:43:14.111 --> 02:43:16.861
you cannot shoot
until you've racked the gun.

02:43:17.819 --> 02:43:20.194
You pull and release

02:43:20.361 --> 02:43:22.611
the sliding mechanism.

02:43:22.819 --> 02:43:24.819
And P hadn't done it
because as she said,

02:43:24.986 --> 02:43:27.611
she had no intention
of shooting the man.

02:43:29.778 --> 02:43:32.778
I don't know about Bond,
but I assume it has to be apparent

02:43:32.944 --> 02:43:34.444
from his books and his films

02:43:34.611 --> 02:43:38.903
that you have
to rack an automatic pistol.

02:43:40.194 --> 02:43:41.903
Of course, you're right.

02:43:42.903 --> 02:43:46.569
I've seen it in films
a thousand times.

02:43:51.486 --> 02:43:52.653
It's morning.

02:43:55.278 --> 02:43:58.903
The snow is gone.
- So the sun must be up?

02:44:00.111 --> 02:44:02.028
Yes, there is sun.

02:44:03.361 --> 02:44:05.319
How can you see it?

02:44:06.361 --> 02:44:10.944
This alley's located so that you
never get direct sunlight here,

02:44:11.111 --> 02:44:15.611
but I can see a small reflection
on the building on the other side.

02:44:22.361 --> 02:44:26.153
I've never managed to figure
out where it comes from.

02:44:26.944 --> 02:44:31.861
It must be some interplay
between windows and towers

02:44:32.028 --> 02:44:35.153
and high buildings.

02:44:37.778 --> 02:44:42.903
It's not much, but it's the sun
you get here at my place.

02:44:47.028 --> 02:44:48.778
It's beautiful.

02:44:58.944 --> 02:45:00.153
In the beginning,

02:45:00.319 --> 02:45:02.153
you said that your only sin

02:45:02.319 --> 02:45:05.486
was that you asked
more of the sunset.

02:45:07.069 --> 02:45:11.028
Meaning, I suppose, that you wanted
more from life than was good for you.

02:45:13.736 --> 02:45:17.444
You were a human being
demanding your right,

02:45:17.611 --> 02:45:19.153
and more than that,

02:45:19.319 --> 02:45:22.694
you were a woman
demanding her right.

02:45:25.986 --> 02:45:28.694
Does that pardon everything?

02:45:30.069 --> 02:45:34.153
Do you think if two men were to
walk down a train looking for women,

02:45:34.903 --> 02:45:38.069
do you think anybody would have
raised an eyebrow,

02:45:38.278 --> 02:45:41.111
or if a man had led the life you had?

02:45:42.778 --> 02:45:47.361
And the story about Mrs. H.
would've been extremely banal

02:45:47.528 --> 02:45:48.861
if you'd been a man.

02:45:50.069 --> 02:45:52.611
And your conquest
would have been a woman.

02:45:53.611 --> 02:45:58.236
When a man leaves his children
because of desire,

02:45:58.903 --> 02:46:01.694
we accept it with a shrug,
but you as a woman,

02:46:02.153 --> 02:46:04.612
you had to take on a guilt,

02:46:04.945 --> 02:46:07.362
a burden of guilt
that could never be alleviated.

02:46:11.362 --> 02:46:14.820
Your abortion was legal,
but more than anything else,

02:46:14.987 --> 02:46:18.987
it was a punishment
you inflicted upon yourself.

02:46:20.112 --> 02:46:23.362
And all in all,
all the blame and guilt

02:46:23.529 --> 02:46:26.070
that piled up over the years
became too much for you,

02:46:26.237 --> 02:46:28.237
and you reacted aggressively,

02:46:28.404 --> 02:46:31.404
almost like a man, I have to say,
and you fought back.

02:46:32.695 --> 02:46:34.070
You fought back
against the gender

02:46:34.237 --> 02:46:38.362
that had been oppressing
and mutilating and killing you

02:46:38.529 --> 02:46:43.029
and billions of women
in the name of religion or ethics,

02:46:43.195 --> 02:46:46.445
or God knows what.

02:46:49.487 --> 02:46:52.404
But I wanted
to kill a human being.

02:46:55.820 --> 02:46:57.820
But you didn't.

02:46:59.779 --> 02:47:02.195
Because of a chance event.

02:47:02.362 --> 02:47:04.404
You call it a chance event,

02:47:05.904 --> 02:47:08.695
I call it subconscious resistance.

02:47:08.862 --> 02:47:11.112
On the surface you wanted to kill,

02:47:11.945 --> 02:47:14.362
but deep down,
you celebrated human worth

02:47:15.404 --> 02:47:17.112
in a veil of forgetfulness

02:47:17.279 --> 02:47:21.779
draped itself over your
knowledge of how to rack a gun.

02:47:24.154 --> 02:47:26.445
Although all this
sounds frighteningly close

02:47:26.612 --> 02:47:29.570
to the clichÃ©s of our times...

02:47:29.737 --> 02:47:34.695
and I'm predisposed to knock
holes in your arguments...

02:47:36.362 --> 02:47:38.529
I'm too tired.

02:47:38.695 --> 02:47:39.987
Well, that's good.

02:47:43.570 --> 02:47:45.612
Why don't you lay down?

02:47:47.904 --> 02:47:49.695
Yes.

02:48:01.029 --> 02:48:03.695
Let me just say that
telling my story

02:48:04.737 --> 02:48:07.737
as you insisted, or permitted,

02:48:09.612 --> 02:48:12.237
has put me at ease.

02:48:13.737 --> 02:48:19.487
At this moment,
my addiction is very clear to me.

02:48:21.862 --> 02:48:23.779
And I've come to a decision.

02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:33.029
Even though only one in a million,
as my dubious therapist said,

02:48:34.279 --> 02:48:38.487
succeed in mentally,

02:48:38.654 --> 02:48:40.862
bodily,

02:48:41.029 --> 02:48:43.237
and in her heart

02:48:43.404 --> 02:48:48.570
ridding herself
of her sexuality...

02:48:48.737 --> 02:48:51.279
this is now my goal.

02:48:52.029 --> 02:48:55.029
But is that a life worth living?

02:48:57.737 --> 02:49:00.737
It's the only way I can live it.

02:49:04.570 --> 02:49:08.362
I will stand up against all odds...

02:49:12.987 --> 02:49:16.404
just like a deformed tree on a hill.

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:28.987
I will muster
all of my stubbornness...

02:49:32.487 --> 02:49:34.654
my strength...

02:49:36.862 --> 02:49:39.570
my masculine aggression.

02:49:41.862 --> 02:49:45.445
But most of all I want
to say thanks

02:49:45.612 --> 02:49:50.237
to my new and maybe first friend.

02:49:50.404 --> 02:49:53.279
Thank you, Seligman...

02:49:54.945 --> 02:49:58.320
who perhaps is happy
when all is said and done.

02:50:05.404 --> 02:50:07.987
I'm happy at any rate

02:50:08.154 --> 02:50:10.237
that the shot didn't go off

02:50:10.404 --> 02:50:13.154
and made me a murderer.

02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:21.612
If I may, I'd like to sleep now.

02:50:25.654 --> 02:50:28.279
I'll make sure
you won't be disturbed.

02:50:31.279 --> 02:50:34.487
And when you wake up,
maybe we could

02:50:34.654 --> 02:50:37.738
discuss your future if you'd like.

02:50:46.571 --> 02:50:49.988
In your new life,

02:50:50.155 --> 02:50:52.863
would you consider
seeking out your son?

02:50:55.696 --> 02:50:57.696
It's possible.

02:51:02.030 --> 02:51:04.113
Good night, Joe.

02:51:05.488 --> 02:51:07.363
Good night, Seligman.

02:52:47.488 --> 02:52:49.196
No!

02:52:51.530 --> 02:52:54.280
But you,
you fucked thousands of men.
