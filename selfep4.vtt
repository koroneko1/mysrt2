Reveals beautiful version of you.

00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:30.405
I can't see my reflection in the mirror.

00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:31.272
3..

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:33.102
and I see your reflection instead.

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:33.602
2..

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.723
Rumors about Neo killed a senior in my school..

00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:37.267
You die.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:37.773
1..

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:43.214
Hey!!!!

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.734
Geez!!!

00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:15.413
Um..

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:18.992
This... is my performance with May,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.023
Oh.. yes, it's Tang-May's performance that about to happen

00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:31.181
Please follow us in our fan page, but right now we have to keep it secret.

00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:31.827
Right?

00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:34.317
So this is a goodbye for now

00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:35.316
See you later..

00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:40.352
The path he walked..

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.016
Hey hey, Nam Mei,

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:48.167
Calm down.. / What the fuck is that?

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:49.827
what did you just fucking do??

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.469
Weren't you going to take a gun from my bag?

00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:56.628
How am I supposed to know that you brought a gun here?

00:01:57.715 --> 00:01:59.349
What kind of idiot brings a gun to school?

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:00.992
What the hell is this about? Tang.

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:04.202
You're going to kill me, aren't you???

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.730
like you did to a guy named Fei, right?

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:14.016
Have you seen the video clip?

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:17.314
And you believe that I'm the one who did it, instantly??

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:21.059
Don't you even ask me?

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:26.102
And the gun that you took...

00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:28.697
Don't you know that there is no any ammunition.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.962
May, Nam-mei...

00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:38.895
I'm so sorry

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:42.644
I thought he was going to take a gun from me..

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:47.761
Hey...Mei

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.980
You asshole..

00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:57.227
You went too far this time..

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:10.742
So.. where are you going?

00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:13.062
Just leave.. go where you wanna go..

00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:15.017
I don't think I can help you anymore.

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:18.764
You told me to come to Chiang Mai...

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.340
And I did so..

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.441
Then why did you come messing with the gun in my bag?

00:03:24.883 --> 00:03:26.563
I was not going to take a gun in your bag.

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:28.568
I just wanted to move the bag so I could sit.

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:30.771
Damn... It's because of you all alone

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:33.318
Because of me.. again?

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:46.304
Well, then....

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.906
how will you go back home?

00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:54.000
I probably sleep in a hotel around here.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.481
How come you don't go home?

00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:58.179
Isn't it dangerous to sleep in a hotel alone?

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.441
Returning Lamphun would be more dangerous.

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.039
Someone sent animal's parts to threaten me.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.181
So.. would you like to go sleep at my house ?

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:10.961
Is it safe to sleep at your house?

00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:14.369
It's definitely safer than a hotel.

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:16.604
It's all up to you then.

00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:20.197
Bro, wait..

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.377
Well... you can drop your bag over there

00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.000
The mirror looks same as the one in my room like you said.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.658
Fuck!!!!!!

00:05:03.077 --> 00:05:03.862
Argh!!!! 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.234
Mark, you mother fucker!

00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:10.960
you see your reflection like me, don't you?

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.987
Why do I have to go through this kind of thing?

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.305
I don't know if I'm supposed to ask you this..

00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:26.895
, but I want to know what really happened.

00:05:27.554 --> 00:05:28.414
Both about the school thing..

00:05:29.044 --> 00:05:30.383
and about a guy named Fei,

00:05:33.136 --> 00:05:33.636
Uh...

00:05:34.693 --> 00:05:35.271
Well...

00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:38.602
but... if you don't want to, that's fine.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.048
I don't want to force you

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:47.482
Well, I met P'Fei for the first time at the athletics club,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.288
I just moved to Wiang Punya Lamphun School

00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:52.288
when I was in Grade 10 (Mathayom 4)

00:05:54.474 --> 00:06:00.000
Umm.. Two, go arrange the training cone there and tell them to be quicker / Okay

00:06:00.446 --> 00:06:03.070
Again, the same mistake.. right?

00:06:03.314 --> 00:06:05.097
That's fine, I'll go help them.

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:06.358
uh

00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:08.959
Are you p'Fei?

00:06:11.351 --> 00:06:12.997
Yes, yes. Hi..

00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:21.291
Oh, you must be Neo.. Grade 10 right? 

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:29.366
So umm... can you wait here for a moment?

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.836
Just take a quick tour around here okay?

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:32.989
I'll go help Two clean up his mess

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.479
Everyone liked p'Fei

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.932
since he was a the school president

00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:48.482
He was the beloved one.

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:54.836
I didn't know why he interested in a no-name guy like me

00:06:55.642 --> 00:06:58.876
but it was nice playing around as a friend with him

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:01.197
Hey Neo, let me help you.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.919
Thanks man..

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.208
Why don't you have a partner?

00:07:05.783 --> 00:07:06.770
Where have all your friends gone?

00:07:07.654 --> 00:07:08.804
Huh?

00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:11.444
Okay? 10 Secends?

00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:12.288
Okay

00:07:12.627 --> 00:07:14.126
You okay? / Okay / Let's start

00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:14.985
1

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:16.442
2

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:17.645
3

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:20.591
4 , 5 , 6..  

00:07:20.592 --> 00:07:22.592
It hurts, ouch, hurts / 7

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:24.592
ouch, enough please, it hurts / 8 , 9

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.462
9.5 / 9.. / Ouch . 

00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:28.083
 It's 9 already! 10 / Ouch!!!

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:29.550
And 11 for lucky number. 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.454
Yeah that's it.

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:35.115
Come on, bro

00:07:35.324 --> 00:07:36.941
What? come on what?

00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:37.441
Eh!

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:38.650
it's your turn..

00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:41.198
Everyone

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.199
finishes your warm-up and goes for a jogging. 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.199
About 10 rounds of the field alright?

00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.552
Boo !!!!!!

00:07:46.552 --> 00:07:50.295
Come on, don't grumble, go now

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:53.958
go fast, don't complain!!

00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:03.561
I thought the reason of him being nice to me..

00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:06.282
is that I'm a new guy in school

00:08:06.283 --> 00:08:08.972
And it all went well being a bro of him,

00:08:08.972 --> 00:08:10.308
a really nice bro.

00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:13.749
What are you doing?

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:15.556
I'm reading Dragon Ball manga.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:20.176
Oh.. Neo... have you read this too?

00:08:24.227 --> 00:08:26.294
I think it's old-fashion.

00:08:27.863 --> 00:08:29.792
It's a legend, bro!

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:31.192
I can reread it again and again.

00:08:35.873 --> 00:08:38.192
Uh... can you take a picture for me?

00:08:39.175 --> 00:08:40.035
ah, ok, let me..

00:08:41.011 --> 00:08:42.107

00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:43.758
I'll post it on IG

00:08:44.594 --> 00:08:45.353
You got it!

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.323
The sunlight is too hard ...

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:52.744
Can I try it in a Korean style?

00:08:54.145 --> 00:08:57.022
How? but ok.. / ok / let's try.. 

00:08:57.501 --> 00:08:58.001
Alright..

00:09:24.393 --> 00:09:26.983
I have to give a credit to my photographer, don't I?

00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:28.595
Oh, alright

00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:31.465
Say cheese, 1 2 ...

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:39.935
(Being my photographer now, being my boyfriend later @ne_oaus)

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:40.977
Boyfriend?  boyfriend what? 

00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:44.322
Take it easy...

00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:46.171
Just want to create a viral content.

00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:49.752
No....

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.178
Take it down please.

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.883
Oh, Wow!! it's a Dragon Ball.

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:00.195
Whoa! This one is... a very new one. Oh wow

00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:01.727
Really interesting.

00:10:01.973 --> 00:10:02.825
Let me read it.

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:03.741
You're really getting on my nerve.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.460
(P'Fei and Neo so cute together)
Terrifying! oh my, wow

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.020
(You and him are so damn lovely)

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.939
(You and him are so damn lovely)
There is a super Saiyan, oh hey, 

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:10.262
(Whoa, what is it between you and this boy?)
There is a super Saiyan, oh hey, 

00:10:10.262 --> 00:10:11.447
(Whoa, what is it between you and this boy?)
Is that Ultraman?

00:10:11.447 --> 00:10:14.756
(Fei : so it's #FeiNeo or #NeoFei 🥰 cr. @ne_oaus my handsome photographer)
(Geez this OTP is so cute)
(Is it One True Pairing or One True Couple)
After p'Fei got close to me,

00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:18.678
(Fei : Sunset with you 🌅)
(Whoops, with who???)
(Neo took this pic, right?!)
everyone in the school thought I was in love with him

00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:21.545
(Fei : 🌺 cr. you know who)
(Yeahh we know who)
(I want more of caption like this)
,but it actually was not.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.517
Wait hey!!!!

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.262
Is this the boyfriend or girlfriend of p'Fei huh?

00:10:31.734 --> 00:10:33.040
Boyfriend I think.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.827
But I supposed it should gir.. girlfriend

00:10:34.827 --> 00:10:38.142
Girlfriend!!!!!!! ha!!!

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:43.145
(laughs)

00:10:56.415 --> 00:10:57.258
Have you been waiting for a while?

00:10:57.258 --> 00:10:58.226
Let go have a dinner

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.554
Go have lunch

00:11:04.807 --> 00:11:08.069
For me I thought he was my nice bro, I didn't want to go too far.

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:10.712
So.. I took a step back 

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.147
But the worse become the worst..

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.442
Here...

00:11:18.943 --> 00:11:19.829
It's Dragon Ball!

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:22.266
Oh, do you have one too?

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.435
Well, it's my father's stuff.

00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:29.372
Yeah, that looks aged-old.

00:11:30.194 --> 00:11:31.256
It's the first volume.

00:11:32.497 --> 00:11:33.795
May I sit?

00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:35.544
No please

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.613
Come on, lemme sit

00:11:50.165 --> 00:11:50.665
Neo,  

00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:54.344
Let me make you a massage?

00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:55.652
?? No 

00:11:56.935 --> 00:11:59.230
Come on ... I'll make a massage for you,

00:12:02.794 --> 00:12:03.730
Hey!! dude

00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:05.544
No means no!

00:12:06.996 --> 00:12:07.983
Why? Neo...

00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:10.915
Everyone misunderstood now

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:12.936
They think there's something between you and me

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.140
It's not the truth tho!

00:12:15.494 --> 00:12:17.920
Neo, calm down. I'm just joking around,

00:12:19.263 --> 00:12:20.037
Whatever then.

00:12:26.796 --> 00:12:28.871
I like you, Neo

00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:39.844
Posting a story of you in my IG

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.203
Uploading you video on social media

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.918
It's all because I like you, Neo.

00:12:46.544 --> 00:12:47.830
Have you ever asked me?

00:12:49.067 --> 00:12:50.333
how I really think about you

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.880
I think of you as my brother.

00:12:55.004 --> 00:12:56.269
Can you stop making me feel awkward?

00:12:56.935 --> 00:12:58.935
Did you try to open up to me?

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:02.141
Everything that I do

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.144
couldn't it conquer your heart? 

00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:06.711
Have I ever asked you?

00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:09.891
Have I asked you to post a story of mine on your IG?

00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.981
Have I ever asked you to like me? 

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.157
Just leave me alone

00:13:17.462 --> 00:13:18.069
That's all I'm want from you...

00:13:34.775 --> 00:13:39.011
(Fei : I'm worthless)
p'fei posted a dramatic status after I rejected him

00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:40.742
And everyone in school blamed  it on me

00:13:40.742 --> 00:13:41.483
(Cheer up p'Fei! ✌🏻 
I won't forgive anyone who did this to you! 😡😡😡😡) 
And everyone in school blamed  it on me

00:13:41.484 --> 00:13:42.985
(Cheer up p'Fei! ✌🏻 
I won't forgive anyone who did this to you! 😡😡😡😡) 
but it's not my fault

00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:44.780
(Lighten up! Every cloud has a silver lining ✌🏻✌🏻)

00:13:45.108 --> 00:13:46.610
(p'Fei Who did anything to you? I will protect you! 💯)

00:13:46.774 --> 00:13:48.488
(Who let you down! I can't stand this! 💢💢💢)

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:49.981
(There are plenty more fish in the sea!)

00:13:50.174 --> 00:13:52.174
(Who did this to my p'Fei!! 😡😡 So sick!)

00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:54.996
(Would you like me to kill him? I could do that for you)

00:13:56.661 --> 00:13:57.161
Neo.

00:13:57.742 --> 00:13:58.514
P'Two..

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.702
Go talk to Fei, please.

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:03.123
What else do you want me to talk to him?

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.023
He'll get better soon

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:06.413
Dude!

00:14:06.413 --> 00:14:08.300
I've never seen him being like this.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.730
This might be the first time..

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:11.559
I guess it kinda hurts him so bad.

00:14:12.934 --> 00:14:14.676
Anyway, try to talk to him, okay? /

00:14:14.676 --> 00:14:15.261
Ok..

00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:26.044
Neo : P'Fei why didn't you come today?

00:14:26.253 --> 00:14:30.673
Fei : Neo, I'm really sorry..

00:14:30.917 --> 00:14:35.305
Neo : It's fine.

00:14:36.237 --> 00:14:39.516
Fei : I'm going to Japan in a day or two, can we meet at the rooftop of abandon building after school?.. 

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.108
Fei : If I'm still worthy..

00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:05.992
Neo

00:15:07.121 --> 00:15:08.778
What's matter with you?

00:15:12.214 --> 00:15:14.204
I just want to ask if you can open up to me..

00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:17.737
In the past, I might have made you feel awkward or uncomfortable.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.600
But I still want to conquer your heart.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.885
Is there a chance..

00:15:24.602 --> 00:15:26.070
that you will belong with me?

00:15:28.501 --> 00:15:30.431
I think of you as a brother

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.561
If you really like me

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.431
why you post a drama status on Facebook and make everyone blame it on me huh?

00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:46.245
Neo. Don't you understand my feelings at all?

00:15:47.678 --> 00:15:51.153
When I have you in life, I'm very happy

00:15:51.718 --> 00:15:52.936
I said I didn't like it.

00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:55.196
And you still do this to me??

00:15:55.196 --> 00:15:55.866
Neo!!

00:15:56.896 --> 00:15:58.080
You made me love you

00:15:58.737 --> 00:16:00.142
And how can you leave me like this?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.009
If I ain't got you

00:16:03.733 --> 00:16:04.619
I'd rather die!

00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:07.434
You won't die, bro

00:16:08.223 --> 00:16:09.445
It's just an excuse.

00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:14.329
Please stop bothering me

00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:16.681
I beg you

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.686
If you goes, I will jump.

00:16:23.138 --> 00:16:24.156
Don't do this, bro.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.138

00:17:30.001 --> 00:17:32.542
Then.. look in my eyes.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:36.770
You can look into my eyes.

00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:38.745
Come on man,

00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:40.910
as if you are touring me out here in Chiang Mai

00:17:45.206 --> 00:17:46.254
Is that Tang?

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.000
I invited Tang to come and play music here, but I didn't come.

00:17:55.044 --> 00:17:57.044
Thank you bro for trusting me.

00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:59.482
Thank you too for believing in us.
